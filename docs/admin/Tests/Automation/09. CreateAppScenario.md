# Create app scenario

Create app scenario needs some metadata to be executed and so divided into to two logical blocks:

- [Actual E2E scenario](#actual-e2e-scenario)
- [Fetching relevant metadata](#fetching-relevant-metadata)
  - [Privacy policies](#privacy-policies)
  - [Language tags](#language-tags)
  - [Use cases](#use-cases)
  - [Agreement consents](#agreement-consents)
  - [Technical user profiles](#technical-user-profiles)

## Actual E2E scenario

Create app scenario consists of the following steps:

- Create app with status "CREATED"
- Validate the storage of the data
- Submit agreements
- Upload necessary documents
- Add role and role description for app
- Select the technical user profile
- Submit the created app

First a new app with status "CREATED" is requested via:

```
POST: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/createapp
```

The body for this request is the requestModel from the test data file which is supplemented
with [privacy policy](#privacy-policies), [language tags](#language-tags) and [use case id](#use-cases).
Next the storage of data is validated against the request model:

```
GET: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/appStatus
```

Afterwards the agreements are signed via a POST request:

```
POST: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/consent/{appId}/agreementConsents - sign the agreements
```

The necessary documents of the types "CONFORMITY_APPROVAL_BUSINESS_APPS", "APP_LEADIMAGE" and "APP_IMAGE" are uploaded via:

```
PUT: /api/apps/AppReleaseProcess/updateappdoc/{appId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

These documents can be defined and uploaded from test data directory or can be generated during the test run if they
were not provided.

Next a new role with its description is added via:

```
POST: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/role
```

with the data from appUserRoles object defined in the test data file.

```
PUT: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/technical-user-profiles - select the technical user profile - important keep the uuid of the technical user inside the request body empty
```

Finally the app is submitted via:

```
PUT: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/submit
```

## Fetching relevant metadata

For POST calls in actual e2e scenario the following metadata is needed:

### Privacy policies

```

The first available privacy policy is used for createApp POST call.

### Language tags

```
GET: /api/administration/staticdata/languagetags
```

All available language tags are used for createApp POST call.

### Use cases

```
GET: /api/administration/staticdata/usecases
```

The first available use case id is used for createApp POST call.

### Agreement consents

```
GET: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/agreementData - get
