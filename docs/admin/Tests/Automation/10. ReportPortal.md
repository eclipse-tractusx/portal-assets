## How to deploy ReportPortal

The helm charts for deploying the ReportPortal can be
found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/product-portal-tools/tree/main/charts/reportportal). Before deploying the
ReportPortal helm chart, the dependencies (elasticsearch, minio, postgresql and rabbitmq) have to be installed. The
steps for local deployment are documented [here](https://github.com/reportportal/kubernetes/tree/develop/reportportal).

## Widget configuration

The following widgets should be configured according to the [docs](https://reportportal.io/docs/user/):

- Passing rate per launch
- Most popular pattern table
- Most failed test case table
- Component health check
- Failed cases trend chart
- Cumulative trend chart

## Test Automation Integration

In order to fetch the test results and connect to the E2E test project, the nuget package ReportPortal.XUnit has to be
added to the project. In addition, the file "ReportPortal.config.json" has to be added to the project and filled
like [this](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-net-xunit#readme).
