#### Invite additional users

#optional step#

The 2nd step inside the registration form is optional. Means, the user can invite additional company members if support in the registration is needed.
Normally this should only be relevant if an user is not authorized to finish the registration in the name of the company. E.g. missing rights to agree to terms and conditions or similar scenarios.
