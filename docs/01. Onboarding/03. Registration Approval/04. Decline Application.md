## Decline Company Application

While the company application is processing the application validations; the administrator can decline the application whenever wanted.
To decline the application the "Cancel Application" Button is enabled for all applications which did not reach the "CONFIRMED" / "DECLINED" status so far.

> **Warning**
> In the current state of implementation the checklist worker and manual process intervention such as the cancellation have no validation/check implemented where the services can validate if the other service might already run. Means; in the unlikely case that the cancellation is triggered while the activation is running in parallel; the activation might overrule the cancellation.
> The scenario is very unlikely and will get handled in an upcoming release.
