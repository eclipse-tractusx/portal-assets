## Can I identify already invited members?

Normal users can not identify companies which are currently in the registration process, but as soon as the registration is finished, the membership will be visible via the partner network.
If you go to the partner network and search for a company, check out the membership icon. If the CX icon is displayed (example see screenshot below) the company is member of Catena-X.
