## My Business Applications

My Business Applications is a component inside the portal which shows the current logged in user which business applications the user can actively used.  
The logic is implemented based on

- company subscribed apps
- user roles

The component can hold up to 4 apps in one page, in case the user has more apps assigned, the component will turn to a carousel with the option to scroll through the pages.

With a click on the business app tile, the user gets automatically redirected to the respective app and via SSO, the user can work inside the app.

The idp of the business application will check the user token. If the user token is valid, the user gets access to the respective tenant. If not, a permission / access error page is getting displayed.  
Important: to enable the functionality, an idp connection must be existing between the business app and catena-x.  
This connection is a user federation which establishes trust between the app idp and catena-x idp and enabled users with a valid key to access there subscribed app tenant.
