## Summary


The app change process is implemented to support app providers to change apps which are active.
<br>
<br>
There is a number of change scenarios, in the first implementation round the following change scenarios are considered
<br>

* App Deactivation
* Add App Role - not yet supported
* Change Documents - not yet supported
* Change Description
* Change Image

<br>

On purpose, the change scenarios are kept limited for the first release of "app change" to ensure that the implementation is supporting a number of key scenarios within the given / available implementation slot.
