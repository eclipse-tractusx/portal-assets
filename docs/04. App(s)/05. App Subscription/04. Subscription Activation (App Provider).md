## Subscription Activation

The "App Subscription Activation" is used to enable app providers to activate the app tenant for the customer.
This includes the

- successfully installation of the customer app tenant (provider side)
- creation of the necessary technical user to connect the app with the CX dataspace (done as part of the activation)
- activation of the app subscription
- storing the app access point (url); this is used to ensure that the customer can access the app via "my apps"

<br>

To activate the subscription, the app provider need to click on the "Activate" button inside the app subscription management board.

The displayed overlay provides an overview of the necessary input data (app access point/url) as well as the information which technical user profile is getting created.
Please note, the technical user created as part of the activation is created under the name of the customer. The app provider is responsible to ensure that the technical user credentials are kept secret and are not getting misused or misconfigured.
