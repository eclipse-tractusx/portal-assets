By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, an overlay with the subscriptiond details is getting displayed.
With the unsubscribe confirmation the app subscription will get set to "INACTIVE". Automatically the technical user, possible linked connector as well as the IdP app instance of the customer will get deactivated. This will ensure that the integration is disconnected.

In the current implementation level, the app prvoider itself is not getting informed about the unsubscription.
