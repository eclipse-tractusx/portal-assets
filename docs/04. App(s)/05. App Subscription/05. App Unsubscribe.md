The unsubscribe subscription feature is available inside the /organization page.

By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, an overlay with the subscription details is getting displayed.
With the unsubscribe confirmation the app subscription will get set to "INACTIVE". Automatically the technical user, possible linked connector as well as the IdP app instance of the customer will get deactivated. This will ensure that the integration is disconnected.

In the current implementation level, the app provider itself is not getting informed about the unsubscription.
