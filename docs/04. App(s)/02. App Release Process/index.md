## Summary

The "App Release Publishing Process" is used to enable App Provider to offer app offerings inside the CX Dataspace.
Via the "App Release Process" page, the app provider gets a transparent overview of the app process steps.

Similar like for services, a publish form need to get filled to be able to release an app on the CX marketplace.
This chapter describes the app release process.

The "App Release Process" screen includes details about:

- "Publish Company App" - Start the app publishing process or jump into your own app overview.
- "Process Guide" - A vertical screen process panel is used to show transparently the app release process steps which need to get processed to publish a app inside the marketplace.
- "Outlook: Marketplace Requirements" - Soon upcoming new requirements are getting published here. This enables companies to prepare for future app release requirements.
