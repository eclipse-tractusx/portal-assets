## UseCase Participation

The use case participation page is created to enable data provider/consumer and solution providers to view their use case participation and to request the participation for new use cases.
The use case participation is a verified credential which is stored on the company wallet which generates trust and liability in the network. The company signing the framework agrees to the use case date sharing rules.

Accessing the page is possible via the user navigation

By clicking on "Edit" the signed use case document can get uploaded by the company and submitted.
The submission will trigger a request on the operator side and needs to get approved by the same before the credential is successfully added inside the company wallet.
