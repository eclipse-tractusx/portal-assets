## FAQ

#### 1. Why can I not upload any certificate

The "Company Certificates" page validates if the user company can upload any certificates (due to an outrunning certificate or a not yet requested certificate type). In case there is no certificate type existing which the user can request, the "Upload Certificate" button will be deactivated.

#### 2. Who validates my VC request after submission

The platform operator is getting informed of the VC request, validates it and approves or declines the request. In both scnearios the requesting user will be informed about the decision. In case of the approval, the VC is created inside the customer wallet.

#### 3. For how long will the credential be valid.

Credential valid till dates are defined by the VC issuer. In most cases credentials are valid for 12 month. In special cases (due to an certificate expiry) the duration might be shorter.
The user can view the duration inside the wallet.
