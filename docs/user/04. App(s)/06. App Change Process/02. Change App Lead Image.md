## Summary

App Providers can adjust the app lead image via the "App Overview" page.
The change has direct impact on the app card displayed on the marketplace as well as the app detail page and other connected pages where the lead image is fetched.
Please note that a delay of displaying the new lead image could appear, in case a longer cache hold of the image is configured.

<br>

To change the app lead image, select "Change Image" via the app management app card sub-menu

<br>

By selecting the button "upload new image" the dropzone element will get displayed and the user can upload the new jpeg/png file.
Please make sure that the image has a valid size - ideally below 0.8 MB

<br>

Important; the change is not reversible. However you can upload a new image whenever you like.
