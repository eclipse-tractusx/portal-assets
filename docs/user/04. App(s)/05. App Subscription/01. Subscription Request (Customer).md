## Summary

## App Subscription Process Description

The app subscription process is a critical mechanism that governs the interaction between interested users and the app provider. This process is not only fundamental to the usage of a business application but also manages the ongoing relationship between the two parties. The following is an outline of the initial implementation of the subscription process:

### Initial App Subscription Process Steps:

1. **Customer Interest**: The user expresses interest in the business application through various means such as visiting the app marketplace, clicking on an advertisement, or through direct inquiry.

2. **App Evaluation**: Before committing to a subscription, the interested company may have the option to evaluate the app. This could be in the form of a free trial or a demo version of the app; depending on the provider.

3. **Subscription Selection**: The user selects an appropriate subscription plan that suits their needs. The plans can vary by features, duration, and price.

5. **Subscription Request**: The customertriggers the subscription request.

6. **Notification**: The app provider receives 2 notification (depending on the configured app manager and app sales manager) via email as well as portal notification.

7. **Negotiation**: App Provider and customer negotiate the details outside the application.

8. **App Ramp-up**: Via the portal configuration service, the app provider starts the configuration setup which includes the technical user setup by the operator services with the app needed technical profile assigned.

9. **Activation**: After successful configuration and deployemnt, the app provider activates the subscription inside the portal or via RestAPI Interface which triggers customer notification of successful activation and up and running app instance. The technical user created for the app service is available on app provider as well as customer side under "Technical User Management".

Important flow chart details: the app subscription process does not handle the contract workflow inside the portal, instead the contract agreement is planned to take place outside the marketplace/portal

After the app subscription activation, the customer company can find the app roles management function under "User Management" and start the assignment of user roles to enable company users to actually access the app with their known/excisting user.
