# Summary

The app subscription process is essential for the usage of an business application, no matter if an app is right away usable or any pre-requisites are given, the app subscription process will manage the relationship between interested app user and app provider.

In the drawing below, the initial process is drafted. Important: this is a draft only and relevant for the initial implementation. As soon as this process is enabled an enhancement is planned which should enable to whole app provider / customer communication on the CX platform.

Important flow chart details: the app subscription process does not handle the contract workflow inside the portal, instead the contract agreement is planned to take place outside the marketplace/portal

After the successful subscription (request by customer and activation by provider) the user management will get enabled for the respective customer company.

With that, the customer can manage user roles for their own users (pre-requisite: those users need to have an active cx account)
