### Step 4 - Technical Integration

For technical integration, the app roles get loaded inside the step 4. Those roles are necessary to enable in the customer subscription scenario the possible user federation including assigned user roles.

With the technical integration feature, the user can:

- upload those app user roles via csv file
- preview uploadable roles
- trigger the role creation for the app (roles can get later updated again via the app change process)
- delete uploaded roles
