#### App Roles

During step 4 of the release process, app roles are loaded to facilitate user federation, allowing users with assigned roles to access the app in a customer's subscription environment.

The function allowed app provider to manage app roles effectively. The following functionalities are included:

- **Upload App User Roles**: Users can upload app user roles through a CSV file. This allows for batch processing of multiple roles, streamlining the integration process.
- **Preview Uploadable Roles**: Before committing the roles to the system, users can preview the roles contained in the CSV file. This ensures that the correct roles are being uploaded and minimizes errors.
- **Trigger Role Creation**: Once the roles are uploaded and reviewed, users can trigger the creation of these roles for the app. This is an initial setup process, but roles can be subsequently updated through the app change process if necessary.
- **Delete Uploaded Roles**: If a role is no longer needed or was uploaded in error or incorrectly, users have the option to delete previously uploaded roles.

#### Technical User Roles

As a second function of the app offering process, the 'Technical Integration' feature allows app providers to define a technical user profile. This profile specifies the technical requirements and credentials necessary for the app to interface directly with centralized hosted services on behalf of the customer.

##### Purpose of the Technical User Profile

A technical user profile is essential for apps that require access to centralized services such as wallets, the BPDM (Business Partner Data Management) pool, registries, and other critical infrastructure components. The profile ensures that the app can operate within the technical and security parameters set by these services.

##### Marketplace Visibility and Customer Decision-Making

The technical user profile is made visible to customers within the app offering on the marketplace. This transparency allows customers to:

- Review the technical requirements of the app.
- Assess compatibility with their own company's security guidelines.
- Make an informed decision on whether to subscribe to the app offering based on the technical user profile provided.

##### Visual Reference

Below is the image of the 'Technical Integration' screen, where app providers can configure and showcase the technical user profile for their app offering.

App providers are encouraged to ensure that the technical user profile accurately reflects the technical requirements and complies with the necessary security standards. For additional information or assistance, app providers should consult the technical documentation or reach out to the support team.
