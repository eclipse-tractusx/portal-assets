#### Agreement to Marketplace Rules and Terms & Conditions

Before you can proceed with uploading your app to the marketplace, you must first agree to the marketplace's rules and Terms & Conditions. This agreement is essential for ensuring that your app adheres to the marketplace's quality standards, operational guidelines, and legal requirements. To complete this step, follow the instructions below:

- **Review the Documents:** Carefully read through the marketplace rules and Terms & Conditions. Pay special attention to sections detailing your rights and responsibilities as a developer/provider, as well as any requirements your app must meet to be eligible for listing.

- **Accept the Agreement:** After reviewing the documents, you will find an option to accept the Terms & Conditions. This usually involves checking a box to indicate your agreement and then clicking a button to confirm. By doing so, you are legally binding yourself to these terms, so ensure you understand them fully before agreeing.

#### Upload of App Dataspace Conformity Certification

The App Dataspace Conformity Certification is a document that certifies your app complies with specific catena-x dataspace, data handling, privacy, and security standards. This certification is crucial for marketplaces that prioritize the safety and privacy of their users as well as it gives the customer the trust that all catena-x dataspace quality standards are followed. Follow these steps to upload your certification:

- **Prepare Your Certification:** Before you can upload your certification, you must obtain it from a recognized certifying authority. Ensure that your app meets all the criteria for certification and that your documentation is up to date. Respective certification authorities can get found on the catena-x homepage.

- **Access the Certification Upload Section:** On the app submission page, look for the section designated for uploading conformity certifications. This section is typically found after the agreement to marketplace rules and Terms & Conditions.

- **Upload Your Certification:** Click on the upload button and select your certification document from your files. The marketplace accepts PDF format. Ensure the document is clear and all information is legible.
