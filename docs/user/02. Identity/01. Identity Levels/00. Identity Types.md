## Levels and Types of Identities

Inside the Catena-x world, managing your identity and data securely and efficiently is one of the key targets.
In the context of identity, Catena-X dataspace manages the following identity types:

* Company Level
* User Level
* Technical Users (system/application level connection)

Next to the identity types; two main identity managing/storage solution are used:

* classic identity and access management solution
* SSI with digital wallets and credentials

In the context of users, the classic solution by using an identity provider solution is used. On top of this, we enabled digital wallets for company identities as part of the data exchange.

## Classic Identity & Access Management Solution

All user and service accounts are managed via classic identity management solution with OIDC authentication method.

For users, the member company can decide if federated identities are used to the company ownIdP/company managedIdP or if the portal operator should manage the user accounts in a sharedIdP (operator owned managed IdP).

## Self-Sovereign-Identity (SSI) & Digital Wallets

### What is a Digital Wallet?

A **Digital Wallet** in the context of a dataspace is an identity wallet of an company (note: it can be many other things as well, but in the context of the CX implementation we are talking about company identities). In detail: it holds your credentials, identity information, and potentially other company data. It's like a virtual safe where your digital identity components are stored securely. Your digital wallet can authenticate you across various platforms and services within the dataspace without the need to repeatedly enter your personal information.
Within the concept of the digital wallet are the concepts of own and managed wallets.

### What are Credentials?

**Credentials** are digital documents that prove various aspects of your identity or qualifications. These can include things like your identity itself (similar to digital ID card - just on a company level), memberships, or permissions to access certain data or services. These credentials are issued by trusted entities within the dataspace and are stored securely in your digital wallet.

### Main roles as part of the wallet/credential management?

1. **Issuer**: Trusted entities in the dataspace issue digital credentials after verifying your identity or certifications. These credentials are then securely stored in your digital wallet.
   Trusted issuer of the Catena-x dataspace are certified and available via the 'SSI Authority & Schema Registry'.

2. **Wallet provider**: Wallet service provider which offer managed wallets for dataspace participants. Status: Coming Soon.
