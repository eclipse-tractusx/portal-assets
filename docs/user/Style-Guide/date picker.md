<img width="560" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/datepicker.png">

#### Principles

A date picker is used to select a specific date or date range from a calendar and spare the user the work of typing in a date. However, user input in the form of typing is still possible.

#### When to use

- Whenever the user needs to input a date or a range of dates
- Whenever you want to limit the dates the user should select from
