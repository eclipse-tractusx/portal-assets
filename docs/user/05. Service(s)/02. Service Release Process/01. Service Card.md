Please make sure that you add a well defined service name. Have a look at the service marketplace to get a feeling about suitable names and define the best name for your service.
Service images are optional. If you don't have an image handy, you can proceed without the image and upload a suitable image later (either by re-opening the service draft state in a later stage or after the service was published on the marketplace)
