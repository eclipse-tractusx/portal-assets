### Step 4 - Technical Integration

The 'Technical Integration' is used to enable the service provider to define the technical user profile needed to run the service. Depending on the service type, the technical user profile is relevant or will be skipped.
If the service provider is planning to publish a dataspace service, such as a managed EDC, the technical user profile is needed to retrieve as part of the service subscription activation for a specific customer the respective technical user.
This profile specifies the technical requirements and credentials necessary for the app to interface directly with centralized hosted services on behalf of the customer.

##### Purpose of the Technical User Profile

A technical user profile is essential for services that require access to centralized services such as wallets, the BPDM (Business Partner Data Management) pool, registries, and other critical infrastructure components. The profile ensures that the service can operate within the technical and security parameters defined.

##### Marketplace Visibility and Customer Decision-Making

The technical user profile is made visible to customers within the service offering on the marketplace. This transparency allows customers to:

- Review the technical requirements of the service.
- Assess compatibility with their own company's security guidelines.
- Make an informed decision on whether to subscribe to the app offering based on the technical user profile provided.

##### Visual Reference

Below is the image of the 'Technical Integration' screen, where app providers can configure and showcase the technical user profile for their service offering.

Service providers are encouraged to ensure that the technical user profile accurately reflects the technical requirements and complies with the necessary security standards.
