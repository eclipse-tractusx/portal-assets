### Getting Started

- **Accessing the Board:**
  - Find the "Company Subscriptions" option in your user navigation menu.
  - Note: This feature is available only if you have been granted "view_subscription" permissions.

### Navigating the Company Subscriptions Page

- **Exploring Your Subscriptions:** 
  - At a glance, view all your company subscriptions.
  - Utilize the search function to quickly find a specific subscription.
  - Apply filters to sort the listings as per your requirement. For example, you can view only active subscriptions or those pending action.

- **Understanding Status Indicators:** 
  - Each subscription is labeled with its current status: *Pending*, *Active*, or *Inactive*. These are displayed for informational purposes.

- **Taking Action:** 
  - Look for the "Unsubscribe" or "Details" buttons next to each subscription.
  - These buttons become prominent and clickable when you hover over them.

### Managing Individual Subscriptions

- **Getting More Information:**
  - Hit the "Details" button to see in-depth information about a specific subscription.
  - On the details page, you'll find the subscription's description, status, offer image, and other relevant details.

- **Unsubscribing:**
  - By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, an overlay with the subscription details is getting displayed. With the unsubscribe confirmation the app subscription will get set to "INACTIVE". Automatically the technical user, possible linked connector as well as the IdP app instance of the customer will get deactivated. This will ensure that the integration is disconnected.


In the current implementation level, the app provider itself is not getting informed about the unsubscribe execution.

Process:
  - note that subscriptions might be connected to offers or technical users; those will automatically get deleted/set to inactive when triggering the unsubscribe function
  - Confirm your choice, and the change will be reflected immediately in your subscription list.

- **Real-Time Notifications:** 
  - A notification message will appear in the top right corner upon successful completion of an action.
  - In xase of an issue, you'll be promptly informed so you can take the necessary steps.

### Additional Features

- **Interactive Elements:** 
  - Some details such as technical usernames might be interactive, allowing you to explore further information about your subscription elements.
