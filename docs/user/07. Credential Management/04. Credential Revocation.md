## Credential Revocation

### Overview

The credential revocation function allows authorized individuals to revoke issued credentials that are currently active. This action is irreversible and will invalidate the credential, ensuring it is no longer recognized as valid within any transactions.

For Credential Revocation two scenarios need to get differenciated:

1. Revocation by issuer
2. Revocation by holder

### Revocation by issuer

#### How to Revoke a Credential

If you have been granted the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission, you can revoke active credentials via the issuer admin board. Follow the steps below to carry out a revocation:

1. **Locate the Credential**: Navigate to the issuer admin board and find the active credential you wish to revoke.

2. **Initiate Revocation**: Click on the revoke icon (represented by a circular arrow) next to the credential you want to revoke.

3. **Confirm Your Action**: After clicking the revoke icon, a confirmation overlay will appear. Carefully review the details, then select "Confirm" to proceed with the revocation or "Cancel" to abort the process.

4. **Revocation Process**: A loading indicator will appear while the system processes the revocation. Once complete, you will receive a notification indicating the outcome of your action.

#### Notifications

- **Success**: You will receive a confirmation message stating that the credential has been successfully revoked and is no longer valid.
- **Error**: If the revocation fails, an error message will be displayed advising you to try again later or contact the site administrator.

#### Important Considerations

- **Irreversible Action**: Revocation is a permanent action. Once a credential is revoked, it cannot be reinstated as valid.
- **Permission Required**: Only users with the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission can perform revocations.
- **Immediate Effect**: The revocation takes effect immediately, and the credential's status will be updated to reflect this change.

### Revocation by holder

As a holder, you have the ability to revoke your own credentials, such as frameworkAgreement or BPN, in case of security concerns or account compromise.

#### How to Revoke a Credential

1. **Log in to your Wallet UI Board.**
   Access your wallet by logging in with your credentials.

2. **Identify the Credential.**
   Within the wallet UI, active credentials will have a revocation icon.

3. **Request Revocation.**
   Click on the revocation icon for the credential you wish to revoke.

4. **Confirm Revocation.**
   Validate your identity if prompted, and confirm the revocation request.

Once the revocation is successful, the credential will be updated to "INACTIVE" and greyed out.

#### Notifications

- **Success**: You will receive a confirmation message stating that the credential has been successfully revoked and is no longer valid.
- **Error**: If the revocation fails, an error message will be displayed advising you to try again later or contact the site administrator.

#### Important Considerations

- **Irreversible Action**: Revocation is a permanent action. Once a credential is revoked, it cannot be reinstated as valid.
- **Permission Required**: Only users with the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission can perform revocations.
- **Immediate Effect**: The revocation takes effect immediately, and the credential's status will be updated to reflect this change.
