## Introduction

The technical user creation process involves creating a specific user account with limited access to a system or network. This user account is typically used for backend to backend service/application connections.
It is important to ensure that the technical user has the necessary privileges and access rights to carry out the tasks required; but also to limit the access rights to those specific services only. This will help to protect the system or network from unauthorized access.

In the Catena-X dataspace, following technical users are provided to all members:
