## Introduction

The technical user creation process involves creating a specific user account with limited access to a system or network. This user account is typically used for backend to backend service/application connections.
It is important to ensure that the technical user has the necessary privileges and access rights to carry out the tasks required; but also to limit the access rights to those specific services only. This will help to protect the system or network from unauthorized access.

In the Catena-X dataspace, following technical users are provided to all members:

<br>

#### Available technical user roles

- Identity Wallet Management (technical user to access own company wallet - request VC, request VP, store VC, etc.)
- BPDM Pool (technical user to connect to the BPDM Data Pool)
- BPDM Partner Gate (allows to view and add business partner data via the owned service gate)
- BPDM Management (View, Add and Delete business partner records from the business partner data pool)
- Dataspace Discovery (technical user for dataspace discovery endpoints)
- Offer Management (technical user to add offers; activate subscription requests and create managed connector registrations for 3rd parties)
- Registration External (Technical user to generate 3rd party registrations by onboarding service provider companies)
