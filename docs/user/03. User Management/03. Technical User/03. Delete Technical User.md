<br>

The technical user deletion will immediately get active. Please ensure that you inform the relevant users about the deletion.

<br>
<br>

> **_NOTE:_** Technical user owner as well as provider (managed tech user owner) can run the delete endpoint - however deletion is not possible if subscription/connector are still active.

<br>
<br>

In case of an service account linked active subscription, the deletion will not be possible, the user need to ensure that the subscription is unsubscribed first, before the technical user can get deleted.
