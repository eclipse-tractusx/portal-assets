## Company Certificate Publishing

Your previous uploaded company certificates are published inside the network.
Either via the _company account page_ which is enabled for all CX members via the partner network OR via an API endpoint which can get accessed/called by CX members as well to retrieve certificates for the collaboration processes - e.g. purchasing processes.

Company certificates shared to others are only those which are in status "active".
