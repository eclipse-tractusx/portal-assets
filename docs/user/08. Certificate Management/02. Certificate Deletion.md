## Company Certificate Deletion

In addition to the ability to upload and manage your company certificates, a certificate deletion function is enabled - allowing you to easily remove any outdated or no longer relevant certificates from your company account.

To delete a certificate, simply locate the certificate you wish to remove in the "Certificates" section of your account settings. Click on the card element with the three dots to open the sub-menu, and then click on the "Delete" option. A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you want to proceed with the deletion.

Please note that once a certificate is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is important to double-check and ensure that you are deleting the correct certificate.

The deletion function provides you with the flexibility to keep your certificate repository up-to-date and clutter-free; as well as giving you complete sovereign responsibility to decide which certificate you wanna share. By removing unnecessary certificates, you can maintain a streamlined and organized collection of only the most relevant and current documents.
