## UseCase Participation

The UseCase Participation page empowers data providers/consumers and solution providers to manage their engagement with various use cases. It facilitates the viewing of existing use case participations and the initiation of participation requests for new use cases. As a cornerstone of trust in the network, the use case participation is realized through a verified credential securely stored in the company's digital wallet. This credential is a testament to the company's commitment, reflecting its adherence to the agreed-upon data sharing rules of the use case framework.

### Accessing the UseCase Participation Page

Navigation to the UseCase Participation page is seamlessly integrated into the user's dashboard. Users can easily access it via the following icon within their navigation panel:

### Requesting Participation

To request participation in a new use case, users will now interact with the "Request" button. This action prompts the user to upload the signed document pertaining to the use case. Once the document is submitted, a participation request is generated and sent to the operator for validation. Approval by the operator formalizes the addition of the new credential to the company wallet, thus expanding the company's use case portfolio.
