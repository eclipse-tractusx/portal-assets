## Onboarding Service Provider (OSP)

The onboarding service provider is a standalone dataspace participant which has as goal to scale the dataspace fast and to provide either a unique onboarding flow for the customer or interacts as OSP to provide a quick and easy connection for their existing network customers to the Catena-X dataspace.

This help page will provide you with all the important information you need to know about Onboarding Service Providers (OSP) in general. We will answer the following questions:

### OSPs

OSPs, short for Onboarding Service Provider, are participants of the Catena-X dataspace, that enable and offer an alternative (to the usual registration process) way of getting access to the dataspace. OSPs integrate features for registration to Catena-X into their own information systems (eg. into their own portals or applications) and provide you with the option to register using their services and your already existing credentials for the OSPs systems.

### Purpose of OSPs

The purpose of OSPs is to enable a faster growth of the the network on the one hand, and on the other hand OSPs can provide a unique and customized registration process for you. This lowers the hurdles for joining the network for the already existing partners of the OSP.

### Find & Access OSPs

The first step is to find an OSP. You're existing partners, that happen to be OSPs for Catena-X might inform you about their status as OSPs and offer you the opportunity to become a participant in the Catena-X network. Alternatively you can find the list provided by the association, that lists all available OSPs. The individual onboarding process depends on the OSPs individual implementation. That might ie. be a registration form or a semi automatic process handled by your OSP. Ideally you get in contact with them and discuss the available options in order to figure out the available/best ways to proceed.
As soon as you registered with you OSP, please follow this [guide](/docs/user/01.%20Onboarding/04.%20OSP/01.%20Onboarding%20with%20an%20OSP.md).
