## User Guide: How to Decline a Registration Invite

### Introduction

This guide explains how to decline a registration invite and permanently delete your user account from the CX Database.

### Declining Registration

#### Step 1: Accessing the Decline Page

When you decide to decline the registration invite, click on the "decline" hyperlink provided in the invitation email. This link will redirect you to the `/decline` page.

#### Step 2: Logging In

Before you can proceed with declining the registration, you will be asked to log in to confirm your identity.

#### Step 3: Declining the Invite

Once logged in, you will be presented with a page that includes the details of your company and associated users. To proceed with the deletion of your company account, follow these steps:

1. **Confirm Deletion**: Read the information carefully to ensure that you understand the implications of deleting your company account.
2. **Delete Account**: Click on the "delete my company" button to initiate the deletion process.

#### Step 4: Deletion Process

After clicking the deletion button, the system will process your request. During this time, the button will display a loading indicator, and you will not be able to click it again until the process is either completed or an error occurs.

#### Step 5: Confirmation or Error Handling

- **Successful Deletion**: If the account is successfully deleted, a confirmation screen will appear, indicating that the process is complete.
- **Error**: If there is an error in the deletion process, an error screen will be presented. You can attempt to delete the account again from this screen.

### Important Considerations

- The decline option is only available if your company's registration is in one of the following statuses: `CREATED`, `ADD_COMPANY_DATA`, `INVITE_USER`, `SELECT_COMPANY_ROLE`, `UPLOAD_DOCUMENTS`, `VERIFY`. If your registration status does not match these, you will be directed to a different screen and provided with a link to return to the `/home` page.
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions (company Admin role) to perform the deletion.

## Customer FAQs:

#### 1. What happens to my data after I decline my invitation?

  When you decline your invitation, your data is set to inactive and remains in the database. The status is updated to deleted, roles are removed, and the user entry and linkages are set to inactive.

#### 2. Can I recover my account after deletion?
  No, once your account is deleted, it cannot be recovered. You will need to get a new company invitation created. If the application is completed and the company is approved, your company admins or collueges can add you again.

#### 3. What if I don't remember my login credentials?

  If you forget your login credentials, you can reset your password using your username (your email address).

#### 4. How long does it take to delete my account?
  The deletion process vary depending on system load. The deletion is executed immediately for customers, while operators may experience a variable timeframe depending on the implementation.

## Operator FAQs:

#### 1. Can I cancel a registration invite after the customer has submitted it?

  Yes, you can cancel an application as long as its status is neither "CONFIRMED" nor "DECLINED". Use the "Cancel Application" button to do this.
 
#### 2. What happens if I cancel an application while it's being processed?

  The status will be updated to reflect the cancellation. There is a small chance that an activation process running simultaneously might override the cancellation, but this is very unlikely and will be fixed in a future 
  update.

#### 3. Is there a way to be sure if my cancellation request went through?

  Currently, there is no confirmation system to notify you if the cancellation was successful. However, the chances of an activation process overriding the cancellation are very low. Check the application status for 
  confirmation.

#### 4. What if I accidentally cancel a customer's registration invite?

  If you accidentally cancel a registration invite, there is no way to undo it at this time. You will need to create a new invitation to proceed with the registration.
