## User Guide: How to Decline a Registration Invite

### Introduction

This guide explains how to decline a registration invite and permanently delete your user account from the CX Database.

### Declining Registration

#### Step 1: Accessing the Decline Page

When you decide to decline the registration invite, click on the "decline" hyperlink provided in the invitation email. This link will redirect you to the `/decline` page.

#### Step 2: Logging In

Before you can proceed with declining the registration, you will be asked to log in to confirm your identity.

#### Step 3: Declining the Invite

Once logged in, you will be presented with a page that includes the details of your company and associated users. To proceed with the deletion of your company account, follow these steps:

1. **Confirm Deletion**: Read the information carefully to ensure that you understand the implications of deleting your company account.
2. **Delete Account**: Click on the "delete my company" button to initiate the deletion process.

#### Step 4: Deletion Process

After clicking the deletion button, the system will process your request. During this time, the button will display a loading indicator, and you will not be able to click it again until the process is either completed or an error occurs.

#### Step 5: Confirmation or Error Handling

- **Successful Deletion**: If the account is successfully deleted, a confirmation screen will appear, indicating that the process is complete.
- **Error**: If there is an error in the deletion process, an error screen will be presented. You can attempt to delete the account again from this screen.

### Important Considerations

- The decline option is only available if your company's registration is in one of the following statuses: `CREATED`, `ADD_COMPANY_DATA`, `INVITE_USER`, `SELECT_COMPANY_ROLE`, `UPLOAD_DOCUMENTS`, `VERIFY`. If your registration status does not match these, you will be directed to a different screen and provided with a link to return to the `/home` page.
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions (company Admin role) to perform the deletion.
