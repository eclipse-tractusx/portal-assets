## Submit company data

The last step of the company application is the verification of the data.
The user can revalidate if al data are correctly added. In case anything is wrong or missing, the "back" button will support to update any entered data.

With the submit of the application, the application form is getting closed and the company application data are submitted for review to the platform operator. The application verification will run through a number of identification validations as well as technical setup to enable the company to participate inside the dataspace.
