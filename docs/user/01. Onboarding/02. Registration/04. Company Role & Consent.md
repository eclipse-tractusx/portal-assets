#### Company Role & Terms and Conditions

Under step 3 "Company Roles & Agreements" the applicator is requested to select the company role with which the application company want to participate inside the network. Beside the "Active Participant", "App Provider" and "Service Provider" are available. Depending on the role, the network agreements/terms and conditions which the application company needs to agree on are getting displayed. Also, the role i relevant to manage the respective access rights/permissions which the application company will receive inside the Catena-X network.  
The role can get easily enhanced in future by enhancing or reducing the role inside the company configuration (available inside the CX Portal).
