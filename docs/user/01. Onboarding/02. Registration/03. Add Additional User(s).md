#### Invite additional users

#optional step#

The 2nd step inside the registration form is optional. Means, the user can invite additional company members if support in the registration is needed.
Normally this should only be relevant if a user is not authorized to finish the registration in the name of the company. E.g. missing rights to agree to terms and conditions or similar scenarios.

With the invite of a user, a personal message can get entered to ensure that the invited user knows the purpose of the invite.
Below an example of the email sent to the invited user can be found:
