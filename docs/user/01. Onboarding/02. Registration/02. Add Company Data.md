## Add Company Data

On the registration page "Add Company Data", you will see a form to enter your company information.
Before entering the company data manually, check if your company has a known BPNL (Business Partner Number Legal) already existing.
In case it exists, you can right away enter the BPNL inside the field. Make sure you enter the exact 16 digits BPN.

In case the BPN doesn't exists yet or you don't know your probably existing BPNL, you can proceed to enter your company data manually.
Use the designated fields to enter all relevant data. Make sure to use the full and correct name of your company.
Next, enter your company's address, including street name, city, state (if applicable), and postal code.
