## Users invited via OSP
This part of the Documentation will help users, who were registered via an Onboarding Service Provider (OSP) to get along.

### Welcome Mail & First Login
As soon as the registration process is done on your OSP side, you will receive a welcome mail, that contains information on how you can proceed. It will provide you with a link and information about where you're gonna be able to log in to the dataspace. 

### T&Cs
When you first log in, you will be prompted with an overlay, that asks you to consent to the terms and conditions. As soon as this is done the overlay will close and you can start browsing the site.

**Please Note:** At this point you will not yet have access to the full functionality, this will only be possible once your registration is finally approved (see next paragraph).

### Status Overlay
You will then see an overlay that tells you about the status of your registration. The individual steps, that need to be checked and done prior to your final registration will be listed here. You can close it at any time and can reopen it with the bar at the top.

**Please Note:** you do not need to perform anything here, these are automatic steps, that generally do not require your active participation at that point.
