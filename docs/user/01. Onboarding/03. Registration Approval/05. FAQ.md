## FAQ

### What happens if I decline an application?

In case of an application "decline", the user(s) registered under the registration account will be informed about the rejection.
Additionally an information of the rejection reason (if available) is getting shared.

### Can I as a registration company view my registration status?

The registration status itself can not get checked. The only information available is the information displayed inside the registration form that the registration is under validation.
As soon as the validation is finished you will be informed about the next possible steps via email.
