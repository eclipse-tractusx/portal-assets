## FAQ

### Customer:

#### 1. Can I cancel my application after I have submitted it?

No, once you have submitted your application, you cannot cancel it.

#### 2. What happens if my application is cancelled after I have submitted it?

If an operator cancels your application while it is being processed, the status will be updated to reflect the cancellation. You will no longer receive any updates about the application. Please check your email,
including your spam folder, for any notifications regarding the cancellation.

#### 3. How will I know if my application has been cancelled?

You will receive an email notification if your application is canceled. Be sure to check your spam folder if you do not see the email in your inbox. Additionally, you can log in to your account to check the status of
your application.

#### 4. What should I do if my application was cancelled by mistake?

If your application was canceled, you will need to submit a new application. Currently, there is no way to reverse a cancellation.
A new registration invite needs to get triggered by the operator and the registration form needs to get newly filled out.

### Operator:

#### 1. Can I cancel an application request after the customer has submitted it for review?

Yes, you can cancel an application as long as its status has not reached "CONFIRMED" or "DECLINED". You can use the "Cancel Application" button to do this.

#### 2. What happens if I cancel an application while it's being processed?

When you cancel an application, its status will be updated to reflect the cancellation. There is a small chance that an activation process running simultaneously might override the cancellation, but this is very
unlikely.

#### 3. How can I be sure that my cancellation request went through?

Currently, there is no confirmation system to notify you if the cancellation was successful. However, the chances of an activation process overriding the cancellation are very low. Check the application status for
confirmation.

#### 4. What if I accidentally cancel a customer's application request?

If you accidentally cancel an application, there is no way to undo it at this time. You will need to create a new invitation to proceed with the application.

### Additional:

### Can I as a registration company view my registration status?

The registration status itself can not get checked. The only information available is the information displayed inside the registration form that the registration is under validation.
As soon as the validation is finished you will get informed about the next possible steps via email.
