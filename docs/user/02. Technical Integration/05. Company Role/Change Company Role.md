## Company Role Change

Company Administrators can change the company participation role of the own company account to enable additional dataspace features or disable the same.

Available Company Roles

- Participant (data provider and data consumer as well as app and service customers)
- App Provider (offering managed or unmanaged applications to enable customers to make more use of their data and enable new business deep dives)
- Service Provider (offering managed services such as dataspace services/consultant services)

The change of the company role will impact the roles and rights inside the portal.
Those are displayed to the company admin when switching the role.
