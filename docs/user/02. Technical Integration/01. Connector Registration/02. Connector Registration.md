Click "Confirm" as soon as all data are added.

<br>

The connector registration will automatically trigger the Self-Description creation of the connector.

<br>

The connector will stay in status "PENDING" as long as the self-description creation is ongoing. Usually the process takes around 1 minute.

### Create new Connector Registration - managedÂ 

In the scenario of a managed connector, the customer will order/purchase a managed connector via the service marketplace.
The service provider will be able to register the connector in the name of the customer. In this scenario, the service provider might use the UI function offered by the portal or directly execute the registration via direct API call.

The option is only available if the user assigned company has the role "SERVICE_PROVIDER" and/or "APP_PROVIDER"

[Connector Registration - API](./06.%20OpenAPI.md)

Additionally the UI Flow is supported - see details below

Select the option "Connector-as-a-service"
