## Policy Management

### Overview

Policies are used to define data access policies as well as usage details.

Access means it defined who can view data offers. Usage defines the data access itself - means contract negotiations and data consumption. E.g. Company A can see that Company B has a Data Offer of last week produced vehicle data - however due to missing usage rights the company can not accept the agreement/data offer and can't access those data.

### Setup Access & Usage Policies

#### Example: "Public Policy"

A public policy is a policy which allows everyone to access the data offer - example see below. Please note - the policy should not be used outside dev/int environments.

        {
          "@id": "always-true",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690454750566,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "87e679c1-6a4e-42e0-90e2-021e2a171f8d",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:leftOperand": "ALWAYS_TRUE",
                "odrl:operator": {
                  "@id": "odrl:eq"
                },
                "odrl:rightOperand": "true"
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          }
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: "Membership Policy"

Membership policy - as defined below - allows only data consumers with the "CX Membership Credential" to view/access a data offer.

        {
          "@id": "membership-required-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690884819803,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "f8bbb24b-dfc9-4879-b7a5-8ac4ed30307b",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                "odrl:operator": {
                  "@id": "odrl:eq"
                },
                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: Combined Policy for "Membership Policy" & "BPN Policy"

In the example below - the data consumer needs to have the "CX Membership Credential" as well as a specific defined BPN to be able to access the data offer

        {
          "@id": "membership-required-with-bpn-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690457344107,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "510615fa-1a8a-4ab6-9b80-5b38bfea2c55",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:and": [
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "BPNL********"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: Combined Policy for "Membership Policy" & Usage: "Traceability Credential"

In the example below - the data consumer needs to have the "CX Membership Credential" to view the data offer (inside the catalog) and traceability to initiate the negotiation.

        {
          "@id": "traceability-usage-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690457344107,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "510615fa-1a8a-4ab6-9b80-5b38bfea2c55",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:and": [
                   {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability", // FrameworkAgreement.{credentialAttributeName}
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "PURPOSE",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "ID 3.1 Trace"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

### Further Specific Examples

For the following Scenarios, we assume there is a Partner 1 (provider) who wants to provide Data for Partner 2 (consumer).

Partner 1 (provider) has the Business-Partner-Number BPN12345.

Partner 2 (consumer) has the Business-Partner-Number BPN6789.

Partner 2 (consumer) signed the Traceability Framework Agreement and followed all the necessary steps that the Credential appears within Partner 2s identity.

So for this example, if Partner 2 does a catalogue request to Partner 1, the following summary credential is provided to Partner 1:

    {
        "@context": [
            "https://w3id.org/2023/catenax/credentials/summary/v1"
        ],
        "id": "<credential uid>",
        "type": [
            "VerifiableCredential",
            "SummaryCredential"
        ],
        "issuer": "<did:web:issuer>",
        "issuanceDate": "2023-06-02T12:00:00Z",
        "expirationDate": "2022-06-16T18:56:59Z",
        "credentialSubject": {
            "id": "<did:web:subject>",
            "holderIdentifier": "BPN6789",
            "items": [
            "MembershipCredential",
            "TraceabilityCredential"
            ],
            "contractTemplates": "https://public.catena-x.org/contracts/"
        }
    }

#### Scenario 1

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy, that Partner 2 can only receive the Contract offer if its BPN matches AND if it has the Traceability Credential (Traceability Contract Signed). If one of those is missing, Partner 2 won't receive a Contract Offer.

##### Partner 1 - Access Policy Example

    {
        "@context": {
            "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
        },
        "@type": "PolicyDefinitionRequestDto",
        "@id": "{{POLICY_ID}}",
        "policy": {
            "@type": "Policy",
            "odrl:permission": [
                {
                    "odrl:action": "USE",
                    "odrl:constraint": {
                        "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
                        "odrl:and": [
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "{{BPN6789}}"
                            },
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Be aware, the credential within the Summary Credential is called "TraceabilityCredential", but as the EDC does a mapping, the EDC Access Policy Entry needs to be named "FrameworkAgreement.traceability"!

All the possible mappings can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-docu/blob/main/docs/user/architecture/cx-3-2/edc/policy.definitions.md#0-introduction

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer because the BPNs are matching and he owns the Traceability Credential.

#### Scenario 2

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy, that Partner 2 can receive the Contract Offer if its BPN matches. But a Contract Agreement should only be created if Partner 2 also signed the Traceability Framework Agreement. So in this case, Partner 2 should receive the Contract Offer in the first place, regardless if it signed the Traceability Framework Agreement. The signing of the Agreement should be checked at the time of contract negotiation.

                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

                                "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer and is able to negotiate the contract because he owns the Traceability Credential.

#### Scenario 3

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy that Partner 2 can receive the Contract Offer if the BPN is matching AND Partner 2 is identified as a Dismantler (owns the "DismantlerCredential").

##### Partner 1 - Access Policy Example

    {
        "@context": {
            "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
        },
        "@type": "PolicyDefinitionRequestDto",
        "@id": "{{POLICY_ID}}",
        "policy": {
            "@type": "Policy",

                    "odrl:constraint": {
                        "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
                        "odrl:and": [
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "{{BPN6789}}"
                            },
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "Dismantler",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 does not receive the Contract Offer as he does not own the Dismantler Credential and is therefore not able to negotiate the contract or request the data.

#### Scenario 4

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy that Partner 2 can receive the Contract Offer if the BPN is matching. Further, Partner 1 only wants to create an Agreement if Partner 2 is identified as a Dismantler (owns the "DismantlerCredential"). Otherwise the Negotiation has to fail.

                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer in the first place.

The contract negotiation, started by Partner 2 fails because he has not been identified as Dismantler and therefore does not own the Dismantler Credential.
