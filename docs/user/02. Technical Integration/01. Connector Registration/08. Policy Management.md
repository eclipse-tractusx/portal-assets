## Policy Management

### Overview

Policies are used to define data access policies as well as usage details.

Access defines who can view data offers. Usage defines the data access itself - meaning contract negotiations and data consumption. E.g. Company A can see that Company B has a Data Offer of last weeks produced vehicle data - however due to missing usage rights the company can not accept the agreement/data offer and can't access the data.

### Setup Access & Usage Policies

#### Example: "Public Policy"

A public policy is a policy which allows everyone to access the data offer - example see below. Please note - the policy should not be used outside dev/int environments.

        {
          "@id": "always-true",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690454750566,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "87e679c1-6a4e-42e0-90e2-021e2a171f8d",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:leftOperand": "ALWAYS_TRUE",
                "odrl:operator": {
                  "@id": "odrl:eq"
                },
                "odrl:rightOperand": "true"
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          }
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: "Membership Policy"

Membership policy - as defined below - allows only data consumers with the "CX Membership Credential" to view/access a data offer.

        {
          "@id": "membership-required-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690884819803,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "f8bbb24b-dfc9-4879-b7a5-8ac4ed30307b",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                "odrl:operator": {
                  "@id": "odrl:eq"
                },
                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: Combined Policy for "Membership Policy" & "BPN Policy"

In the example below - the data consumer needs to have the "CX Membership Credential" as well as a specific defined BPN to be able to access the data offer

        {
          "@id": "membership-required-with-bpn-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690457344107,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "510615fa-1a8a-4ab6-9b80-5b38bfea2c55",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:and": [
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "BPNL********"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

<br>
<br>

#### Example: Combined Policy for "Membership Policy" & Usage: "Traceability Credential"

In the example below - the data consumer needs to have the "CX Membership Credential" to view the data offer (inside the catalog) and traceability to initiate the negotiation.

        {
          "@id": "traceability-usage-policy",
          "@type": "edc:PolicyDefinition",
          "edc:createdAt": 1690457344107,
          "edc:policy": {
            "@id": "510615fa-1a8a-4ab6-9b80-5b38bfea2c55",
            "@type": "odrl:Set",
            "odrl:permission": {
              "odrl:action": {
                "odrl:type": "USE"
              },
              "odrl:constraint": {
                "odrl:and": [
                   {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "Membership",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability", // FrameworkAgreement.{credentialAttributeName}
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                  },
                  {
                    "odrl:leftOperand": "PURPOSE",
                    "odrl:operator": {
                      "@id": "odrl:eq"
                    },
                    "odrl:rightOperand": "ID 3.1 Trace"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            "odrl:prohibition": [],
            "odrl:obligation": []
          },
          "@context": {}
        }

### Further Specific Examples

For the following Scenarios, we assume there is a Partner 1 (provider) who wants to provide Data for Partner 2 (consumer).

Partner 1 (provider) has the Business-Partner-Number BPN12345.

Partner 2 (consumer) has the Business-Partner-Number BPN6789.

Partner 2 (consumer) signed the Traceability Framework Agreement and followed all the necessary steps that the Credential appears within Partner 2s identity.

So for this example, if Partner 2 does a catalogue request to Partner 1, the following summary credential is provided to Partner 1:

    {
        "@context": [
            "https://w3id.org/2023/catenax/credentials/summary/v1"
        ],
        "id": "<credential uid>",
        "type": [
            "VerifiableCredential",
            "SummaryCredential"
        ],
        "issuer": "<did:web:issuer>",
        "issuanceDate": "2023-06-02T12:00:00Z",
        "expirationDate": "2022-06-16T18:56:59Z",
        "credentialSubject": {
            "id": "<did:web:subject>",
            "holderIdentifier": "BPN6789",
            "items": [
            "MembershipCredential",
            "TraceabilityCredential"
            ],
            "contractTemplates": "https://public.catena-x.org/contracts/"
        }
    }

#### Scenario 1

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy, but Partner 2 can only receive the Contract offer if its BPN matches AND if it has the Traceability Credential (Traceability Contract Signed). If one of those is missing, Partner 2 won't receive a Contract Offer.

##### Partner 1 - Access Policy Example

    {
        "@context": {
            "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
        },
        "@type": "PolicyDefinitionRequestDto",
        "@id": "{{POLICY_ID}}",
        "policy": {
            "@type": "Policy",
            "odrl:permission": [
                {
                    "odrl:action": "USE",
                    "odrl:constraint": {
                        "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
                        "odrl:and": [
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "{{BPN6789}}"
                            },
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Be aware, the credential within the Summary Credential is called "TraceabilityCredential", but as the EDC does a mapping, the EDC Access Policy Entry needs to be named "FrameworkAgreement.traceability"!

All the possible mappings can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-docu/blob/main/docs/architecture/cx-3-2/edc/policy.definitions.md
The CX-Credential-Types can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-docu/blob/main/docs/architecture/cx-3-2/3.%20Verifiable%20Credentials/CX-Credentials/Standardized%20CX-Credential.md

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer because the BPNs are matching and he owns the Traceability Credential.

#### Scenario 2

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy, that Partner 2 can only receive if the Contract Offer and its BPN match. A Contract Agreement should only be created if Partner 2 also signed the Traceability Framework Agreement. So in this case, Partner 2 should receive the Contract Offer, regardless of the Traceability Framework Agreement being signed. The signing of the Agreement should be checked at the time of contract negotiation.

                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "{{BPN6789}}"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

                                "odrl:leftOperand": "FrameworkAgreement.traceability",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer and is able to negotiate the contract because he owns the Traceability Credential.

#### Scenario 3

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy that Partner 2 can receive the Contract Offer if the BPN is matching AND Partner 2 is identified as a Dismantler (owns the "DismantlerCredential").

##### Partner 1 - Access Policy Example

    {
        "@context": {
            "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
        },
        "@type": "PolicyDefinitionRequestDto",
        "@id": "{{POLICY_ID}}",
        "policy": {
            "@type": "Policy",
            "odrl:permission": [
                {
                    "odrl:action": "USE",
                    "odrl:constraint": {
                        "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
                        "odrl:and": [
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "BusinessPartnerNumber",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "{{BPN6789}}"
                            },
                            {
                                "@type": "Constraint",
                                "odrl:leftOperand": "Dismantler",
                                "odrl:operator": {
                                    "@id": "odrl:eq"
                                },
                                "odrl:rightOperand": "active"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 does not receive the Contract Offer as he does not own the Dismantler Credential and is therefore not able to negotiate the contract or request the data.

#### Scenario 4

Partner 1 wants to create an Access Policy which only allows Partner 2 to receive the Contract Offer if the BPN is matching. Further, Partner 1 only wants to create an Agreement if Partner 2 is identified as a Dismantler (owns the "DismantlerCredential"). Otherwise the Negotiation has to fail.

                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

##### Desired Outcome

Partner 2 receives the Contract Offer.

The contract negotiation, started but Partner 2 fails because he has not been identified as Dismantler and therefore does not own the Dismantler Credential.
