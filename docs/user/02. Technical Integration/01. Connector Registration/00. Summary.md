## Summary

For a full technical onboarding and to enable the network to browse through and find available data connectors, each data provider or connector owner is in ownership to register their connectors in the network which will trigger on top a self description (GAIA-X).

The details below show the user interface as well as the available endpoints to trigger the registration.

In the technical integration / setup of the connector, 3 different scenarios are available

connector as a service (request a service via a service provider)
bring your own connector
no connector required

Connector stakeholders are mainly app providers and data provider (active CX participants along the automotive value chain).

For the scenario "bring your own connector", the user will be able to register the connector by entering the relevant information. In the case of a "connector as a service" case, the relevant data fields need to get still defined by the Product Team CaaS (not in scope for release 1)
