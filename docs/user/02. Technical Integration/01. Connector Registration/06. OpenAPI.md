## Open API - Create new Connector Registration - managed

In the connector registration scenario OpenAPIs are offered for managed connector registration.  
To be able to run the interface, a technical user is needed which can be generated easily via the user management.

[How to create a technical user](/docs/user/03.%20User%20Management/03.%20Technical%20User/02.%20Create%20Technical%20User.md)

<br>

Service Provider can create a new registration for a company which subscribed for a service provider service

Same as for self-owned connectors, the connector registration will automatically

- trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored, the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".
