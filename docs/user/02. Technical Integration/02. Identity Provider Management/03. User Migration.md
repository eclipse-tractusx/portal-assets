#### Migrate existing user accounts to the new created IdP

With the configuration of a new IdP, existing user accounts should not get lost. In the previous section "Create the new idp record" it was already described, how the admin user can connect his/her existing user account with the new company idp. In this section the user migration of additional available user accounts is handled.
<br>

For the migration of additional existing user accounts, which have been created under the shared IdP previously, the administrator can call the user migration list via the IdP config page.

By clicking on the "Users" sub-navigation icon, a overlay with the user migration list as json or csv file is getting displayed.

</p>

<br>

Download the list and add for each user, which is supposed to get migrated to the new IdP.
When opening the csv, add the users identity provider user id in the respective available section - see screenshot below - and upload the csv file as soon as all respective data are added.

Example below shows how to fill the csv file which got downloaded by the IT Admin. In the example 2 users are existing and supposed to get connected to the idp88.
Therefor the admin adds for each user the providerUserId and providerUsername. Note: for unique identification the providerUserId is relevant, the userName is only used for reference.

</p>

<br>
As soon as the csv is ready, upload the file by placing it inside the dropzone area of the overlay and press "Upload User List" on the bottom.
The upload includes the update of all those user connection inside the platform IdP by adding the new IdP connection to each of the users.
In case any error occurs, details of the upload errors will get displayed per user:

</p>

<br>

With that, the user migration is successfully done - you can validate the user list again by re-opening the users list of the IdP.
After the successful config, the new IdP can get enabled and the old IdP can get disabled and deleted if required.
