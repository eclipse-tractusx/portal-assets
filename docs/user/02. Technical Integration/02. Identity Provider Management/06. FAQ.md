#### Can I have multiple active IdPs?

Yes, it is possible to have multiple active IdPs - however note that it might result into an extended administrative work to manage a huge number of users across multiple IdPs. IdP owners are always requested to keep the number of active IdP connections to a minimum.
<br>
<br>

#### Is SAML supported?

SAML is not supported by the CX dataspace. As per the standards OIDC is used for all interactions.
<br>
<br>

#### If I connect my company IdP with the platform IdP - which data will get logged by the platform IdP?
