## Introduction

The technical user creation process involves creating a specific user account with limited access to a system or network. This user account is typically used for backend to backend service/application connections. 
It is important to ensure that the technical user has the necessary privileges and access rights to carry out the tasks required; but also to limit the access rights to those specific services only. This will help to protect the system or network from unauthorized access. 

In the Catena-X dataspace, following technical users are provided to all members:

<br>

#### Available technical user roles
* Connector User (technical user for data connector to connect to the digital twin registry)
* Identity Wallet Management (technical user to reach out the the company owned managed identity wallet)
* BPDM Pool (technical user to connect to the BPDM Data Pool)
* Dataspace Discvoery (technical user to call the Connector Discovery service)
* App Tech User (technical user for app tenants - user is usually auto created as part of a app tenant activation - includes digital twin access and bpdm lookup)
* Service Management (technical user for service and app providers to create connector registration, store autosetup url and use the portal opneAPI for autosetup)
