### As a service or app provider, am I able to create a technical user in the name of my app/service customer?

As service or app provider you can create technical users only per subscription. The user management panel is not used, since security validations are necessary which are running as part of the service/app activation.
With the activation of an offer subscription, automatically a technical user will get created which is having following parameter:

* OfferSubscriptionId: Subscription ID to which the technical user belongs to 
* Owner: customer id
* attributes: customer bpn
* role: (depending on the previous setting)
