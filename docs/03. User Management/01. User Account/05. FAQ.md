# FAQ

#### Can I delete an user of another company?

No, it is not possible to delete an user which is assigned to another company account.

The person which is triggering the deletion needs to belong to the same company or it has to be the user itself which triggers the deletion for the own account.

#### How can I delete an user account which is company IdP federated?

In the scenario of federated company IdP user accounts, the user deletion will only be effective inside the Catena-X idp. The company IdP wont be effective on the company IdP; only the shadow user with the assigned roles inside Catena-X will get deleted.

#### Can I revert a user deletion?

No, user deletions can't get reverted.

#### If my/a user has 2 idp connections, will the user deletion delete both idp connections?

Yes, even with multiple idp connections, the user deletion will work as planned. The user access will get reverted and the user account details will get deleted.
