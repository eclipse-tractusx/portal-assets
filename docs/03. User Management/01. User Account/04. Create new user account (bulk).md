## Create a new user account (bulk)

Bulk user creation is available inside the 'User Management' menu to allow company admins and IT admins to create multiple users in as ingle action.
Please note that it is suggested to separate the bulk user create groups per role, since the multiple user upload does not support different role assignments per user.

#### Preparation

The bulk user creation overlay allows you to download the csv template.
Download the template to get started and fill out the necessary details - each user account needs to get added in a own row.

Depending on your IdP type, the mandatory fields might differ - generally following attributes are needed per user

- first name
- last name
- email

Make sure that you do not add duplicates. In case you do, they will run on an error while creating.
