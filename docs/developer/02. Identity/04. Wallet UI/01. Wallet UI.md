## Wallet UI

With release 24.03. the wallet UI was introduced inside the portal application.
The wallet ui connects the company wallet (technical component as managed service which is provided by the operator) with an user interface giving the company users an access to the content.

Inside the wallet UI the owned credentials, their expiry as well as the authority are displayed.

### Authentication

The authentication is a direct connection to the backend service of the wallet (as per release 24.03.).
The user jwt token is getting validated and used to authorize.
With the implementation of 24.05. a change is planned.
