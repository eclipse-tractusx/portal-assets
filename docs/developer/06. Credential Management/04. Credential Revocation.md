## Credential Revocation Feature Documentation

The credential revocation flow is enabled for two scenarios:

1. Recovation by issuer
2. Revocation by holder

### Revocation by Issuer

#### Description

The issuer admin board now includes a feature that allows the revocation of "Active" credentials. Issuers assigned with the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission can utilize this feature to manage the valid status of issued credentials.

#### Revocation Capability

Issuers with the necessary permissions can now revoke credentials that are marked as "Active." This feature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the credentialing system.

#### UI Integration

A revoke option, represented by the MaterialUI `SettingsBackupRestore` icon, has been added to the issuer admin board. This icon is displayed next to each "Active" credential, enabling easy access to the revocation function.

This option is only visible and accessible to users who have been granted the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission.

#### Confirmation Overlay

When the revoke icon is clicked, a confirmation overlay appears to ensure the issuer intends to proceed with the revocation. The overlay provides "Cancel" and "Confirm" options to either abort or continue with the process.

#### API Integration

Upon confirming the revocation, the system will trigger an API call to the revocation endpoint with the specific credential ID that is to be revoked.

- **URL**: `/api/revocation/issuer/credentials/{credentialId}`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Permission**: `revoke_credentials_issuer`

The `{credentialId}` in the endpoint's path should be replaced with the actual ID of the credential being revoked.

#### Loading State and User Feedback

A loading indicator is displayed while the revocation request is processed. Feedback is provided to the issuer once the API responds, indicating the success or failure of the revocation.

#### Success/Error Handling

The user will receive a notification upon successful revocation. In the event of a failure, an error message will be displayed.

#### Permissions Check

The system verifies that only users with the "revoke_credentials_issuer" permission can access and use the revocation feature, adhering to the established permission system.

### Revocation by Holder

#### API Endpoint

- **URL**: `/api/revocation/credentials/{credentialId}`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Permission**: `revoke_credential`

#### Validation

- Ensure that the caller of the endpoint is the holder.
- Check if the credential is "active" and revocable.
  - If "yes", proceed with revocation.
  - If "no", respond with "already done".

#### API Responses

- **200 OK**: Revocation successful.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed.
- **403 Forbidden**: Authorization failed.
- **404 Not Found**: Credential ID not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side error.

#### Success/Error Handling

The user will receive a notification upon successful revocation. In the event of a failure, an error message will be displayed.
