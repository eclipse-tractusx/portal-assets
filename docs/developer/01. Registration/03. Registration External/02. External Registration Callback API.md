### Summary

**Scenario:** Receive as Onboarding Service Provider active feedback of my customer registration state
<br>
<br>

#### Functional Description

inform the OSP about the status change (via endpoint - if applicable)

- **1st Integration**: Implement the callback service function on the OSP side and share your API endpoint with authentication details
- **2nd Receive real-time registration status:** Receive in real-time customer registration status feedbacks and customer attributes

<br>
<br>

##### Integration Interface

Before coming to the details of the status call; the OSP needs to register the owned OSP endpoint which should be used to provide customer registration status callbacks.
The OSP can GET the configured OSP endpoint as well as PUT a new endpoint. Note: only one endpoint can get configured

```diff
! GET: api/administration/registrationStatus/callback
! PUT: api/administration/registrationStatus/callback
```

<br>

Request Body

        GET: api/administration/registrationStatus/callback

        {
          "callbackUrl": "string",
          "authUrl": "string",
          "clientId": "string",
          "clientSecret": "string"
        }

        POST: api/administration/registrationStatus/callback

        {
          "callbackUrl": "string",
          "authUrl": "string",
          "clientId": "string",
          "clientSecret": "string"
        }

<br>
<br>

##### Validations

- normal endpoint patterns are configured to ensure that the input fits with the expected content
- endpoint can get triggered by real-users as well as technical users if holding the right permissions

##### Specific Logics implemented

- the PUT endpoints allow empty request body to enable the OSP to delete the configured endpoint details

<br>
<br>

##### Receive Real-time registration data

As soon as the customer registration status is reaching any of the below defined status:

- "Submitted"
- "Active"
- "Declined"

the OSP gets actively informed about the status change as well as receiving details such as customer "BPNL", detailed message, etc.
Note: the OSP is only getting informed, if a callback URL is configured (see **Integration** details above)

<br>
<br>

Request Body

        {
          “externalId": “externalID of the application POST call",
          “applicationId": “our own applicationID",
          “bpn": “BPN of the company which is assigned to the application",
          “status": “application Status",
          “message": “additional message - e.g. the manual message which the portal admin added in case of declining the registration"
        }

<br>
<br>

##### Validations

Error Scenarios
=> if the API call fails, the call is getting re-triggered. The retrigger time can get scheduled on the backend service side.

##### Specific Logics implemented

none
