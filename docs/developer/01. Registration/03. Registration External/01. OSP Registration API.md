### Summary

**Scenario:** Onboarding Service Provider (External Provider) triggers the company registration
<br>

Functional Description
The onboarding service provider can use the endpoint POST /api/administration/registration/Network/partnerRegistration (via technical user) to submit a new company registration.
The endpoint is available for all OSP members of the operator. By having the company role "Onboarding Service Provider" external users with the relevant permission 'External Registration' can get created and used to call the endpoint.
