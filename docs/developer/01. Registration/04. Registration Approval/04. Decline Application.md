## Decline Company Application

While the company application is processing the application validations; the administrator can decline the application whenever wanted.
To decline the application the "Cancel Application" Button is enabled for all applications which did not reach the "CONFIRMED" / "DECLINED" status so far.

##### API Implementation

The endpoint "decline" sets the "Registration_Verification" checklist item to "FAILED" incl. a time stamp, as well as the decline message added by the operator.
The endpoint can only get triggered/executed if the application is in status "submitted" and the "Registration_Verification" in the Status "TO_DO".
Additionally the endpoint sets the Application Status to "DECLINED" and the status of the company to "REJECTED". The users of the applying company will get an email after the process informing about the rejection including the decline message of the operator.

Request Body:

      "comment": "string"

> **Warning**
> In the current state of implementation the checklist worker and manual process intervention such as the cancellation have no validation/check implemented where the services can validate if the other service might already run. Means; in the unlikely case that the cancellation is triggered while the activation is running in parallel; the activation might overrule the cancellation.
> The scenario is very unlikely and will get handled in an upcoming release.
