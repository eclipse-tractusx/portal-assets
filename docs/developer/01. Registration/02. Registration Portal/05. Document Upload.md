<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/registration-upload-certificates.png">
<br>
In Step 4, the users are asked to upload the company identification.
<br>
All documents uploaded under the same application register form are shown. If a second user has already uploaded a doc, the user will be able to see as well as delete this document as well; as long as the users belong to the same company application.
<br>
<br>

### Implementation details

- API Get Documents
- API Upload Document
- API Delete Document
- API Download Document

<br>
<br>

#### API Get Documents

Fetching documents already loaded by a company assigned user which is connected to the current application.  
<br>

```diff
! GET /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

<br>
<br>

#### API Upload Document

Documents are uploaded into the portal.document table and are connected via the user_id and document_type to the respective application.  
<br>

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

<br>
<br>

#### API Delete Document

Documents can get deleted as long as the documents are still in the right/respective status.  
<br>

```diff
! DELETE /api/registration/documents/{documentId}
```

<br>
<br>
Important: only documents under the same application are deletable. Additional the application needs to be in any status beside submitted; approved and declined.
<br>
The document deletion does also validate the document type. Only types related to the registration can get deleted.
<br>
<br>

#### API Download Document

Uploaded documents can also get viewed / downloaded by the user. To do this, the user needs to open the document by clicking on the document name. Automatically the document will get downloaded.  
<br>

```diff
! GET /api/registration/Documents/{documentId}
```

<br>
<br>

> Validation
>
> - only pdf documents are allowed to get uploaded (api and fe secured)
> - maximum size of document upload: 8MB (api secured)
> - authentication and authorization are FE and BE implemented
> - backend validation: only users which are linked to the correct company and application can run the respective endpoints

<br>
<br>

##### #5 Transition to the next registration step

With the transition to the next process step, the endpoint

```diff
! PUT /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/status
```

is called. In all the other registration steps, this endpoint is not called since the actual transition endpoints posting/storing the customer data in the backend is automatically doing the status change. Only for the document step this change is happening standalone.

The endpoint includes following implementation logic:

- if the application is in status "Created" the application status can only get updated to "Add_Company_Data", other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
- if the application is in status "Add_Company_Data" the application status can only get updated to "Invite_User" , other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
- if the application is in status "Invite_User" the application status can only get updated to "Select_Company_Role", other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
- if the application is in status "Select_Company_Role" the application status can only get updated to "Upload_Documents", other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
- if the application is in status "Upload_Documents" the application status can only get updated to "Verify", other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
- if the application is in status "Verify" the application status can only get updated to "Submitted", other status changes are not allowed (beside keeping the status the same)
  the user can not change the status from "submitted" to any other status.
- user can not change the status if the application is in status "Confirmed", or "Declined"
