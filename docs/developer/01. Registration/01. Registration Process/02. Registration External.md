### Summary

This registration method allows users to register through a partnership with an external registration service. This involves API communication between the external partner's system and the portal/core application.

<br>
<br>

### Workflow

1. **User Chooses External Partner**: Outside of the operator portal, the user selects an onbaording provider (e.g. a platform which is OSP of CX and where the company is already successfully registered)
2. **Select the option to get registered at CX**: The user selects at the external provider side to register for the CX dataspace.
3. **API Registration**: Upon selection, the partner system calls the operator application's API endpoint with the company/user's data.
4. **Registration Creation**: The operator validates the data and creates a new account.
5. **Registration Company confirms again the will to register**
6. **Registration Validation and Approval**: The operator validates the registration and runs through the approval process till activation.
7. **OSP Callback of successful registration**: Upon confirmation/approval, the operator application calls the partner system API's with successful registration and partner BPNL.

**Scenario:** Onboarding Service Provider (External Provider) triggers the company registration
<br>

Functional Description
The onboarding service provider can use the endpoint POST /api/administration/registration/Network/partnerRegistration (via technical user) to submit a new company registration.
The endpoint is available for all OSP members of the operator. By having the company role "Onboarding Service Provider" external users with the relevant permission 'External Registration' can get created and used to call the endpoint.
