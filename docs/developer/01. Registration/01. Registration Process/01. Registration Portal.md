### Summary

This registration method is initiated when an existing operator within the system sends an invite to a prospective user to join the platform. The flow involves verification links, form submissions, and account creation processes.

<br>
<br>

### Workflow

1. **Invite Generation**: An operator generates an invite from the admin panel.
2. **Sending Invite**: The system sends an invite email with a unique registration link to the prospective user.
3. **Company Registration**: The user clicks on the link, fills in the required information, and completes the registration process.
