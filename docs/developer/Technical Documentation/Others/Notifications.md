## Summary

Notification Services are used to send messages to one or several users. Usually notification services are known as push services, where a system/application is pushing notifications to a mobile device of the user.  
In CX, the idea of push notification to a mobile device is something which is currently not in scope of the implementation, however the initial service of notifications inside the portal is planned as an mvp for Release 2/3.

++ highlight messages which have read status "false"
++ enable urls inside the message
++ user navigation count is red, if messages with needed actions are unread

<br>

##### WebApplication User Interface

###### User Navigation

Scenario 1
If unread messages are "0" the notification icon wont show up. Instead only the user icon will be displayed

<img width="70" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/211213885-30afb622-9fdb-4cb2-b94b-c50d2c9fd272.png">

<br>

Scenario 2
If unread messages are > 0 AND the actionRequired are = 0; the user icon with notification "false" state will get displayed. Inside the notification count bubble the number of "unread" messages will be shown.

<br>

Scenario 3
If unread messages are > 0 AND the actionRequired are > 0; the user icon with notification "true" state will get displayed. Inside the notification count bubble the number of "actionRequired" messages will be shown.

## Implementation Details

### Database

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/211214049-4970683d-22ab-4757-8ef2-85e1b2db6634.png">

<br>

Important: the notification message is not available/stored inside the database; instead the db is only storing message metadata and the actual message text is handled inside the FE translation file located in the following repo structure.
Front-End repo cx-portal/src/assets/locales/en/notification.json

<br>
<br>

### #1 Get User Notification Count

The get user notification count job is used to fetch the count of unread notifications, as soon as the user logs in to the CX Network.  
Via the user token, all relevant information will get fetched from the portal db and getting displayed in the user account.
<br>

```diff
! GET /api/notification/count
```

<br>
<br>

### #2 Get User Notification Count-Details

With the user notification details, read and unread count per filter can get fetched.  
<br>
The endpoint is a pure calculation/counting of the different metadata found below:

- read
- unread
- infoUnread
- offerUnread
- actionRequired
- unreadActionRequired
  <br>

```diff
! GET /api/notification/count-details
```

<br>

Response Body

          {
            "read": 18,
            "unread": 30,
            "infoUnread": 11,
            "offerUnread": 1,
            "actionRequired": 25,
            "unreadActionRequired": 18
          }

<br>
<br>

### #3 Get User Notification Details

The get user notification details is following the "get user notification count" job.  
The details job will only run when the user is clicking on the notification sub-menu.  
The endpoint supports pagination inside the metadata section.
<br>

Additionally the endpoint supports to

- only get read messages
- only get unread messages
- get only a specific notification type
- get only due notifications
- sorting by date and read status
  <br>

```diff
! GET /api/notification
```

<br>

Response Body  
Please note, the "content" text is only an example, each service has its own content attributes defined. Details to the actual content can get found here: /notificationDetails

          {
            "meta": {
              "totalElements": ##,
              "totalPages": ##,
              "page": ##,
              "contentSize": ##
            },
            "content": [
              {
                "id": "uuid",
                "created": "date",
                "typeId": "label",
                "notificationTopic": "label",
                "isRead": false or true,
                "content": "{\"OfferId\":\"uuid\",\"CompanyName\":\"string\",\"OfferName\":\"string\"}",
                "dueDate": null or date
              }
            ]
          }

<br>
<br>

### #4 PUT User Notification "read" / "unread"

The user can select a notification inside the notification screen and put that notification to "read" or "unread".  
This will impact the notification count of #1. Since #1 will only show those notification as "new" or "to be checked" notifications which are not set to "read"
<br>

```diff
! PUT /api/notification/read or /api/notification/read?notificationStatusId=UNREAD
! PUT /api/notification/read or /api/notification/read?notificationStatusId=READ
```

<br>
<br>

### #5 DELETE User notification

With the delete user notification, a notification can get deleted. The function is triggered by the user himself and will be executed without any chance for notification recovery.
<br>

```diff
! DELETE /api/notification/{notificationId:guid}
```

<br>
<br>

### #6 Implemented Sorting feature

User can sort results based on given sorting possibilities. The sorting will act jointly with the view component.  
Means, if the user did selected the view "Info Only" and now wants to also sort the results; the sorting will get executed on the view "info only" and not on all notifications.  
Therefore following endpoints are implemented:
<br>

###### VIEW ALL (inside the filter)

Newest first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&onlyDueDate=true&sorting=DateDesc  
Oldest first. {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&sorting=DateAsc  
Unread first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&sorting=ReadStatusAsc

<br>

###### VIEW APP (inside the filter)

Newest first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=OFFER&sorting=DateDesc  
Oldest first. {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=OFFER&sorting=DateAsc  
Unread first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=OFFER&sorting=ReadStatusAsc

<br>

###### VIEW Info (inside the filter)

Newest first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=INFO&sorting=DateDesc  
Oldest first. {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=INFO&sorting=DateAsc  
Unread first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&notificationTopic=INFO&sorting=ReadStatusAsc

<br>

###### View Action Required (inside the filter)

Newest first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15 &notificationTopic=ACTION&sorting=DateDesc  
Oldest first. {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15& notificationTopic=ACTION&sorting=DateAsc  
Unread first: {hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15& notificationTopic=ACTION&sorting=ReadStatusAsc

<br>
<br>

### #7 Implemented Views

<br>

When the user is opening the page "All" is preselected and the notification as per the endpoint:  
https://{hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&sorting=DateDesc  
<br>

When the user clicks on the view tag "app only" notification as per the endpoint are showing app:  
https://{hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15¬ificationTopic=OFFER&sorting=DateDesc  
<br>

When the user clicks on the view tag "info only" notification as per the endpoint are showing app:  
https://{hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15¬ificationTopic=INFO&sorting=DateDesc  
<br>

When the user clicks on the view tag "messaged with action required" notification as per the endpoint are showing app:  
https://{hostname}/api/Notification?page=0&size=15&onlyDueDate=true&sorting=DateDesc
