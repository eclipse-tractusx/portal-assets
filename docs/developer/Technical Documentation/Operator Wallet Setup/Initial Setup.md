# Initial operator wallet setup

The initial operator wallet setup is handled by the seeding process of the portal. The seeding process will create an application checklist which is waiting for the DIM Middle Layer response.
The application checklist process than will take care of the initial wallet setup and will create the BPNL and Membership Credential.

> > Remarks: The seeding on the [DIM Middle Layer](https://github.com/SAP/ssi-dim-middle-layer/) side from version 2.1.0 onwards was adjusted as well. It will seed a tenant for the operator and a process which starts to create the wallet for the operator.
