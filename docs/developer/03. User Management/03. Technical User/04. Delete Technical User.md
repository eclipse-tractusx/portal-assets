### Delete Technical User

Delete an existing technical user
Only technical users of the own company can get deleted.
Permission: "delete_tech_user_management"

As part of the deletion API, the following tasks get executed:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(API delete call) -->|Pass the technical user id| B["`Receive technical user
     for company`"]
    B --> C{Check technical user}
    C --> |existing & active| D{"`Linked to active/pending connector`"}
    C --> |not existing| E("Error 404 - serviceAccount {serviceAccountId} does not exist")
    C --> |technical user not active| P("Error 409 - technical user {serviceAccountId} is not status active")
    C --> |technical user owned by other company| Q("Error 403 - Only provider or owner of the technical user are allowed to delete it")
    D --> |false| F{"`Linked to active
     offer subscription`"}
    D --> |true| G("`Error 409 - Technical User is linked to an active connector. Change the link or deactivate the connector to delete the technical user.`")
    F --> |false| H{Is external user}
    F --> |true| I("`Error 409 - Technical User is linked to an active subscription. Deactivate the subscription to delete the technical user.`")
    H --> |true| J{"`Create process still
     in progress`"}
    J --> |true| K("`Error 409 - Technical user can't be deleted because the creation progress is still running`")
    J --> |false| L("`Create delete process
    set state to PENDING_DELETION`")
    H --> |false| M{has clientClientId}
    M --> |true| N(Delete client from keycloak)
    M --> |false| O(set state to DELETE)
    N --> O
```

Endpoint can be called via:

```diff
! DELETE: api/administration/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}
```

Validation:

- only owned or managed technical user that are active can get deleted
- the deletion is not possible if the user is linked to an `active` offer subscription or an connector in state `active` or `pending`

> **_NOTE:_** Technical user owner as well as provider (managed tech user owner) can run the delete endpoint.
