## Delete an user

Technical users created under the same company id can get deleted by user administrators.
To delete an user, just open up the user details and click the "delete" button.

### Delete Service Account

Delete an existing service account  
Only service accounts of the own company can get deleted.
Permission: "delete_tech_user_management"

As part of the deletion API, the following tasks get executed:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(API delete call) -->|Pass the service account id| B["`Receive service account
     for company`"]
    B --> C{Service account exists and user has access}
    C --> |true| D{"`Linked to active/pending connector`"}
    C --> |false| E(409 Error)
    D --> |false| F{"`Linked to active
     offer subscription`"}
    D --> |true| G(409 Error)
    F --> |false| H{Is external user}
    H --> |true| I{"`Create process still
     in progress`"}
    I --> |true| J("`Skip all creation process steps
     set state to DELETE`")
    I --> |false| K("`Create delete process
    set state to PENDING_DELETION`")
    H --> |false| L{has clientCLientId}
    L --> |true| M(Delete client from keycloak)
    L --> |false| N(set state to DELETE)
    M --> N
```

Endpoint can be called via:

```diff
! DELETE: api/administration/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}
```

Validation:

- only owned or managed service account can get deleted
- the deletion is not possible if the user is linked to an active subscription or an connector in state active or pending

> **_NOTE:_** Technical user owner as well as provider (managed tech user owner) can run the delete endpoint - however deletion is not possible if subscription/connector are still active.
