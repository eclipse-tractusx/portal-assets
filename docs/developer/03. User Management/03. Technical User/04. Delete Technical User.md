### Delete Service Account

Delete an existing service account  
Only service accounts of the own company can get deleted.
Permission: "delete_tech_user_management"

As part of the deletion API, the following tasks get executed:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(API delete call) -->|Pass the service account id| B["`Receive service account
     for company`"]
    B --> C{Service account exists is active and user has access}
    C --> |true| D{"`Linked to active/pending connector`"}
    C --> |false| E("Error 404 - serviceAccount {serviceAccountId} not found for company {companyId}")
    D --> |false| F{"`Linked to active
     offer subscription`"}
    D --> |true| G("`Error 409 - Technical User is linked to an active connector. Change the link or deactivate the connector to delete the technical user.`")
    F --> |false| H{Is external user}
    F --> |true| I("`Error 409 - Technical User is linked to an active subscription. Deactivate the subscription to delete the technical user.`")
    H --> |true| J{"`Create process still
     in progress`"}
    J --> |true| K("`Error 409 - Technical user can't be deleted because the creation progress is still running`")
    J --> |false| L("`Create delete process
    set state to PENDING_DELETION`")
    H --> |false| M{has clientClientId}
    M --> |true| N(Delete client from keycloak)
    M --> |false| O(set state to DELETE)
    N --> O
```

Endpoint can be called via:

```diff
! DELETE: api/administration/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}
```

Validation:

- only owned or managed service account that are active can get deleted
- the deletion is not possible if the user is linked to an `active` offer subscription or an connector in state `active` or `pending`

> **_NOTE:_** Technical user owner as well as provider (managed tech user owner) can run the delete endpoint.
