```diff

```

      {
        "meta": {
          "totalElements": 0,
          "totalPages": 0,
          "page": 0,
          "contentSize": 0
        },
        "content": [
          {
            "serviceAccountId": "uuid",
            "clientId": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "serviceAccountType": "MANAGED/OWN",
            "isOwner": true,
            "offerSubscriptionId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
            "connector": {
              "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
              "name": "string"
          },
        "offer": {
              "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
              "type": "APP",
              "name": "string",
              "subscriptionId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6"
          }

- isOwner provides the information of the technical user is managed by another company for the acting company. Example: Company A has a managed EDC subscribed. The managed EDC provider creates in the name of Company A an technical user to connect the managed EDC to the dataspace. For Company B the technical user will be displayed as "isOwned: false" since the user is managed by the service provider but exist in the name of/for Company A.
- in case the technical user is not connected to any app/service - the "offer" section will be empty
- per default, only active service accounts are responded; additionally there is the chance to filter on INACTIVE service accounts by adding a "INACTIVE" status tag inside the api endpoint request
