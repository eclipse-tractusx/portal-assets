## Implementation - API Details

<br>

### Get Technical User Role Profiles

Technical users are currently managed under one single client. "Tech_User_Management" client.
All technical user roles are created inside this client as "composite role". With that, permissions of the actual client where the technical client will need to get access to, can get assigned to the roles inside the client "Tech_User_Management".

On the FE side, for role assignment, only the composite roles will be visible for the user

### Technical Users Created via service/app subscription

When a technical user is created as part of a service or app activation, it is generated by the app or service provider (referred to as the offer provider) and associated with the actual customer (the user's owner).

During the app registration process, the offer provider can configure technical user profiles. If a technical user profile includes a role listed in the `UserRolesAccessibleByProviderOnly` configuration, the created technical user will be classified as provider_owned.

If the selected roles are not in the `UserRolesAccessibleByProviderOnly` configuration, the technical user will be visible to both the offer provider and the customer. Otherwise, it will only be visible to the offer provider.

With the POST api, the backend service will
<br>

- creates the user inside Keycloak central idp
- updates the data inside portal iam_service_accounts
- updates the data inside portal technical_users
  - depending on the selected roles the technical_user_type_id is either set to `managed` or `provider_owned`
  - subscription_id is filled by the customer app/service subscriptionID
- updates the data inside portal technical_users_assigned_roles
- As part of the user creation, the user gets set to "ACTIVE" inside the portal db.
