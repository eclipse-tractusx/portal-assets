### Migrate existing user accounts to the new created IdP

With the configuration of a new IdP, existing user accounts should not get lost. In the previous section "Create the new idp record" it was already described, how the admin user can connect his/her existing user account with the new company idp. In this section the user migration of additional available user accounts is handled.
<br>

For the migration of additional existing user accounts, which have been created under the shared IdP previously, the administrator can call the user migration list via the IdP config page.
