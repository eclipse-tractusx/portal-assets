<br>

To delete an IdP, the IdP must be first of all disabled.
Without disabling the IdP a deletion will not be offered/possible.
As soon as the IdP got disabled; the deletion can get triggered. Please note - deletions can't get reverted and will directly take place.
If there are users assigned to this IdP only, those users won't be able to login again until those users are migrated to another IdP.

#### Implementation details:

- [ ] "Delete IdP" option is available under the "Action" sub-menu
- [ ] "Delete IdP" option is only visible for IdPs which are deactivated
- [ ] when clicking on "Delete IdP" the endpoint to delete the IdP (already implemented) is running, till the delete process was successful/unsuccessful the user should see a "load" icon inside the sub-menu and cant re-trigger the menu item
- [ ] if the idp delete is successful, the respective information "IdP got deleted" is displayed on the top right and auto closes after 5 seconds (see design below) and the idp is gone from the idp list on the main page
- [ ] if the idp delete is unsuccessful, same as for the success the error is getting displayed on the top right; with the message "Something went wrong. IdP got not deleted."

<br>
<br>

The successful deletion is confirmed with an toast message.
In case the deletion fails, the user is getting informed by the same method.
In case of an failure the operator should get contacted.
