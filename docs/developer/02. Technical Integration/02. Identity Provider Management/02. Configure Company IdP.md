## IDP Configuration

Functional Link: [Link](/docs/user/02.%20Technical%20Integration/02.%20Identity%20Provider%20Management/02.%20Configure%20Company%20IdP.md)

<br>

### Create IdP

The initial overlay is used to create the IdP record with the respective IdP type. Currently only OIDC is supported and not enhancement to other types are planned.

<br>

</p>

<br>

The configuration of the IdP includes the

- Display Name - displayed in the login screen on the company select page - please use a name which the user can relate too; also its important to use a unique value
- Identity Provider Type - sets the type of the IdP; own in case the new configured IdP is used for the own company only; managed if the new configured IdP is supposed to get used for third parties - this is only possible for OSPs and OpCos
- Authentication Method - as per latest standards only OIDC is supported
  <br>

#### Implementation details:

- [ ] if the user clicks on the action button "create new IdP" the overlay (see above) is getting displayed with the new design
- [ ] the overlay has an "cancel" (not "back") button which is clickable by the user and results into an closed overlay
- [ ] the button "create IdP entry" is only active if the Display Name is entered
- [ ] "create IdP entry" needs to support load function as long as the backend API did not response to the FE - the user should be only able to click the button once and the button should display a load element till backend response is available.
- [ ] if the "create IdP entry" fails, display inside the overlay an error and let the user not direct to the next page

<br>
<br>

#### API Create new IdP connection

```diff
Endpoint POST: api/administration/identityprovider/owncompany/identityproviders
```

got enhanced by adding the typeId\* inside the request body

\*typeIds: MANAGED and OWN are supported; SHARED not - user cant create on request a SHARED IdP

<br>

Validations:

- "identityProviderType: "managed"" is only allowed/possible if the acting user assigned company is either a OSP or an operator (to be checked via company_assigned_role)
- "identityProviderType: "own"" is allowed no matter which role the company of the acting user owns
- "identityProviderType: "shared"" is allowed....

<br>
<br>

Business Logic Change:

no matter which identityProviderType is used, store the user assigned company as identity_providers.owner

<br>
<br>

### Configure IdP

After the idp record creation, the idp needs to get configured with the respective authentication details and connect urls.

</p>

<br>

The configuration of the IdP includes the

- metadata url - this is the configuration url - public available/accessible to to fetch the customer idp config details (such as: logout url, userinfo url, redirect url, etc.)
- client id - generated on the customer IdP to allow the CX idp to connect for user federation between the customer idp and the CX idp
- secret - generated on the customer IdP to allow the CX idp to connect for user federation between the customer idp and the CX idp

<br>

#### Implementation details:

- [ ] all information displayed in the blue table section (bottom) are fetched from the api; all other fields are input fields and need input patterns and error messages
- [ ] add question mark icons for the different input fields via locale files (this should be already implemented, please check if it already supports multi language)
- [ ] metadata url icon is a copy icon which acts on hover as well as on click. When clicking the metadata url is getting saved inside the clipboard and icon turns green to show the user that the "save" was successful
- [ ] as soon as all input fields are added with content without errors, the user can click "Save Metadata"
- [ ] "Save Metadata" needs to support load function as long as the backend API did not response to the FE - the user should be only able to click the button once and the button should display a load element till backend response is available.
- [ ] if the "Save Metadata" fails, display inside the overlay an error and let the user not direct to the next page

<br>
<br>

#### API Update IdP Config

<br>

```diff
PUT /api/administration/identityprovider/owncompany/identityproviders/{identityProviderId}
```

<br>

when calling the endpoint - validate the acting user assigned company and check if the company is listed as the idp owner (via identity_providers.owner)

- if yes, proceed
- if no, exception needed - "User not allowed to run the change for identity provider {identityProviderId}"

<br>
<br>

### User Connection

The final step is the user connection test. For this the acting user needs to enter the own user ID into the input field. This user ID will get stored and is the unique identifier when performing the login. Via this ID the existing user account inside the portal iam solution is getting linked to the company IdP user account. This enables the user to login with the already assigned user roles.

Implementation details:

- [ ] if the user clicks on the action button "save metadata" the configuration overlay (see above) is getting displayed with the new design
- [ ] with the back button the user gets directed to the previous screen (note - currently we can not display any pre-entered data inside the screen - but its planned to do this asap) - means display "\*\*\*" for the client secret, display the client id and the metadata url (currently this is not possible - we should discuss this as soon as I am back from vacation)
- [ ] the input fields needs input pattern, error message and support icon with multi language support
- [ ] if the input field is filled, the "connect" button will be active and clickable
- [ ] "connect" needs to support load function as long as the backend API did not response to the FE - the user should be only able to click the button once and the button should display a load element till backend response is available.
- [ ] if the "connect" fails, display inside the overlay an error and let the user not direct to the next page
