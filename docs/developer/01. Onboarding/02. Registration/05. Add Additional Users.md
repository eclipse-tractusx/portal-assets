<br>
As part of the registration and onboarding process the registration user has the chance to add additional user accounts. NOTE this is not to be used for generic company user account creation. This process is added to provide the option to add user accounts which are mandatorily needed for the company registration. E.g. if the company has a own role for signing terms and conditions. In this case the registration user can invite this additional person to the registration process and request that person to execute the respective step.

Below the supported roles can get found:

- Signing Manager
- Legal Admin
- Company Admin

### Implementation Details: Add Aditional Users

#### API Details

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/inviteNewUser
```

Request Body

    {
      "userName": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "firstName": "string",
      "lastName": "string",
      "roles": [
        "string"
      ],

The endpoint is called when the respective registration form step is displayed.
With those information, the invited users and their participation state can get viewed.
(e.g. "Pending"/"CREATED" - User was invited but did not yet login)
