### Summary

This registration method is initiated when an existing operator within the system sends an invite to a prospective user to join the platform. The flow involves verification links, form submissions, and account creation processes.

<br>
<br>

### Workflow

1. **Invite Generation**: An operator generates an invite from the admin panel.
2. **Sending Invite**: The system sends an invite email with a unique registration link to the prospective user.
3. **Company Registration**: The user clicks on the link, fills in the required information, and completes the registration process.

Functional Description
Inside the CX Portal, users with the role of an CX Admin will be able to invite new companies to the CX Network.
The invite itself will be started with the

The initial contact person (which could be the CEO, a Manager or Business Consultant) will receive two emails by Catena-X, after the CX Administrator has initiated the invite.
