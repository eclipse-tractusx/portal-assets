## Implementation

### #1 Store User Favorites

The App favorite function is offered in the app marketplace to highlight an app easily and ensure that I as an user can quickly find the app again.
User favorites are stored inside the DB - the portal db will know which user has which favorite selected and can easily retrieve the information for the Front-End
