### Agreement to Marketplace Rules and Terms & Conditions

Before the service provider can proceed with the release process, they first must agree to the marketplace's rules and Terms & Conditions. This agreement is essential for ensuring that the service provider service adheres to the marketplace's quality standards, operational guidelines, and legal requirements.
To display the relevant agreements, respective linked documents and to store the provider consent, the following endpoints are to be used:

- GET /api/services/servicerelease/agreementData - used to fetch all necessary serviceReleaseProcess agreements
- GET /api/administration/documents/frameDocuments/{documentId} - used to enable the user to access agreement documents
- POST /api/services/servicerelease/consent/{serviceId}/agreementConsents - post consent
- GET /api/services/ServiceRelease/{serviceId}/serviceStatus - to check the current given consent status

#### #1 Retrieve Terms & Conditions

Terms and Conditions are fetched via the endpoint

```diff
! GET: /api/services/servicerelease/agreementData
```

<br>

Response Body

    [
      {
        "agreementId": "uuid",
        "name": "string",
        "documentId": "uuid"
      }
    ]

<br>

Style

If documentId inside response body is != NULL display the respective agreement as link - example:

<img width="591" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/consent-contract-tickbox-document.png">

<br>

If the documentId is NULL, the agreement is displayed without link (as currently implemented) - example:

<img width="590" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/consent-contract-tickbox-nodocument.png">

<br>
<br>

#### #2 Retrieve Documents

Depending on the response of the endpoint #1 GET agreements, the user will be enabled to download related documents from the portal to read through the relevant agreement details. Expected formats are pdf, however other formats can get supported as well.

```diff
Get: /api/administration/documents/frameDocuments/{documentId}
```

<br>

Response Body

    document file

<br>
<br>

#### #3 Store Consent for Agreements

The given consent or the unapproved consent for the needed agreements are stored via the POST endpoint.
The endpoint will store the newly added agreement status as well as update existing consent status if necessary.

```diff
! POST: /api/services/servicerelease/consent/{serviceId}/agreementConsents
```

<br>

Response Body

    {
      "agreements": [
        {
          "agreementId": "uuid",
          "consentStatus": "ACTIVE"
        }
      ]
    }

<br>
<br>

### Conformity Certification

The Service Dataspace Conformity Certification is a document that certifies that the service provider service complies with specific data handling, privacy, and security standards. This certification is crucial for marketplaces that prioritize the safety and privacy of their users.
To support the conformity certificate upload, following endpoints are available:

- GET /api/services/ServiceRelease/{serviceId}/serviceStatus - to retrieve already uploaded certificates (if any existing)
- PUT /api/services/ServiceRelease/updateservicedoc/{serviceId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents - to store the conformity certificate
- DELETE /api/services/ServiceRelease/documents/{documentId} - used to delete the conformity certificate

Note, only PDF is supported.
