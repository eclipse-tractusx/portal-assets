<img width="536" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/service-creation-contract-constent.png">

Depending on the response of the endpoint #1 GET agreements, the user will be enabled to download related documents from the portal to read through the relevant agreement details. Expected formats are pdf, however other formats can get supported as well.

<br>

### Implementation Details

#### #1 Retrieve Terms & Conditions

Terms and Conditions are fetched via the endpoint

```diff
! GET: /api/services/servicerelease/agreementData
```

<br>

Response Body

    [
      {
        "agreementId": "uuid",
        "name": "string",
        "documentId": "uuid"
      }
    ]

<br>

Style

If documentId inside response body is != NULL display the respective agreement as link - example:

<img width="591" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/consent-contract-tickbox-document.png">

<br>

If the documentId is NULL, the agreement is displayed without link (as currently implemented) - example:

<img width="590" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-assets/main/docs/static/consent-contract-tickbox-nodocument.png">

<br>
<br>

#### #2 Retrieve Documents

Terms and Conditions with an document ID in API endpoint #1 can get retrieved via the document endpoint GET /frameDocuments/{documentId}

```diff
Get: /api/administration/documents/frameDocuments/{documentId}
```

<br>

Response Body

    document file

<br>
<br>

#### #3 Store Consent for Agreements

The given consent or the unapproved consent for the needed agreements are stored via the POST endpoint.
The endpoint will store the newly added agreement status as well as update existing consent status if necessary.

```diff
! POST: /api/services/servicerelease/consent/{serviceId}/agreementConsents
```

<br>

Response Body

    {
      "agreements": [
        {
          "agreementId": "uuid",
          "consentStatus": "ACTIVE"
        }
      ]
    }
