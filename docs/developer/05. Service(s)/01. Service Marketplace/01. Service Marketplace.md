## Service Marketplace

The service marketplace is providing a list of services (such as consultancy but also datapsace services) to enable CX members to participate in the dataspace.

Beside the generic list, services can get viewed in specific pre-configured views

## Implementation Details

### #1 Search

The search is front-end enabled currently.  
Means the whole search is acting on the front end loaded services.  
Its planned to change this as soon as a search engine is implemented.

<br>
<br>

### #2 Filter

Filters provide two different views which can get easily switched by the user

     - for "Consultant Service": {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&serviceTypeId=CONSULTANCE_SERVICE

<br>

### #3 Sorting

Sorting is enabled and works jointly with the filters

     Endpoint
     - ALL - Newest First: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ReleaseDateDesc
     - Dataspace Service - Newest First: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ReleaseDateDesc&serviceTypeId=DATASPACE_SERVICE
     - Consultant Service - Newest First: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ReleaseDateDesc&serviceTypeId=CONSULTANCE_SERVICE

     - ALL - Provider: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ProviderDesc
     - Dataspace Service - Provider: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ProviderDesc&serviceTypeId=DATASPACE_SERVICE
     - Consultant Service - Provider: {host/domain}/api/Services/active?page=0&size=15&sorting=ProviderDesc&serviceTypeId=CONSULTANCE_SERVICE

<br>
<br>

### #4 Get all active services

API is used to display the active services of the CX network based on the released services. If a service is under review or creation, the service wont show up in this view.  
Only those services in status "ACTIVE" are getting displayed.
<br>

```diff
! GET /api/services/active
```
