## Implementation

With the service release approval, the service is getting activated for the service marketplace.
The approval is triggered by clicking on the approval icon inside the service card:

### #1 Approve Service Release

The approve service release function is used to release an service which is in status "In Review" to the marketplace.

With the approval the status of the service is getting updated to "ACTIVE" and the service provider (service manager) is getting informed about the successful release.
<br>

```diff
! PUT: /api/services/servicerelease/{serviceId}/approveService
```

<br>

With the approval of the service, the releaseDate is getting set => offers.released_date

<br>
Details regarding the notification created for the service provider can get found in the notification service documentation: Notification Service
