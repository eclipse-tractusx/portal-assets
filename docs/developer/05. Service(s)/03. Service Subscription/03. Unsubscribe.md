### Implementation

#### #1 PUT Unsubscribe

The subscription customer (offer_subscriptions.company_id) is able to unsubscribe from an service.
<br>

Business Logic:
With the PUT api, the backend service will

- set linked "connector" instances to "DELETED"
- set the SD document of the "connector" to "DELETED"
- set linked "technical user" to "DELETED"
- last but not least the subscription record itself gets updated to "INACTIVE"

Validation:

- user can only unsubscribe subscriptions where the user assigned company is subscription holder/owner
- only subscriptions in status "ACTIVE" can get set to "INACTIVE" - other status subscriptions will result in an error "Subscription in wrong status. Action not possible."

<br>

```diff
! PUT /api/services/{subscriptionId}/unsubscribe
```
