## Notifications

As part of the standard feature of the portal, every user has a own notification section / inboy.
The notifications are grouped

* App 
* Info
* Action

Notifications are created based on different actions inside the dataspace - e.g. new user role assignment, approval of app releases, etc.

On every screen, the user can view the notification unread count via the count added on the user ico on the top right

Note: A green count means that xx number of unread messages are existing, but non of those requires an action.
A red count is displaying the number of unread messages where user action is required.
