## Summary

The service deactivation function allows users to easily and conveniently deactivate their service from the app marketplace. This feature gives users the power to control their own offers and allows them to easily stop or start offer whenever they like.
With the deactivation, the service won't be available on the marketplace anymore - this means, new subscriptions can not get triggered. However already active subscriptions do stay active and are accessible by the respective customer.
