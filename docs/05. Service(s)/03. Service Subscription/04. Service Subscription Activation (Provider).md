## Subscription Activation

The "Service Subscription Activation" is used to enable service providers to activate the service tenant for the customer.
This includes the

- successfully installation of the customer service tenant (provider side)
- creation of the necessary technical user to connect the service with the CX dataspace (done as part of the activation and only of a technical user profile is stored)
- activation of the service subscription
- storing the service access point (url); this is used to ensure that the customer can access the service via "my apps"

<br>
<br>

To activate the subscription, the service provider need to click on the "Activate" button inside the service subscription management board.
