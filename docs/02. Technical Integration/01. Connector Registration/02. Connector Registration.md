### Create new Connector Registration - managedÂ 

In the scenario of a managed connector; the customer will order/purchase a managed connector via the service marketplace.
The service provider will be able to register the connector in the name of the customer. In this scenario; the service provider might use the ui function offered by the portal or directly executes the registration via direct API call.

The option is only available if the user assigned company has the role "SERVICE_PROVIDER" and/or "APP_PROVIDER"
