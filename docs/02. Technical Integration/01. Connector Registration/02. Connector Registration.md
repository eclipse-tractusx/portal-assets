Click "Next" and enter the following data:
* Connector Name (own defined and only used for own reference)
* Connector URL (endpoint under which the connector can get reached)
* Location (2digit country code - ISO)

Click "Confirm" as soon as all data are added.

<br>

The connector registration will automatically trigger the daps certificate via the public key which was uploaded by the user. Same applies for the Self-Description of the connector.

<br>

In case the DAPS is failing, the connector will still get registered and DAPS registration will be hold on "PENDING". In the scenario of an PENDING connector; the user will be enabled to retrigger the missing service registration (in this case DAPS) to enable the usage of the connector inside the network fully.

### Create new Connector Registration - managed 

In the scenario of a managed connector; the customer will order/purchase a managed connector via the service marketplace.
The service provider will be able to register the connector in the name of the customer. In this scenario; the service provider might use the ui function offered by the portal or directly executes the registration via direct API call.
