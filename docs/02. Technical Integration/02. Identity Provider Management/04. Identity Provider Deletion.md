To delete an IdP, the IdP must be first of all disabled.
Without disabling the IdP a deletion will not be offered/possible.
As soon as the IdP got disabled; the deletion can get triggered. Please note - deletions can't get reverted and will directly take place.
If there are users assigned to this IdP only, those users won't be able to login again until those users are migrated to another IdP.
