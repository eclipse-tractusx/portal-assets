A drop down list is a graphical control element, similar to a list box, that allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a drop-down list is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value.

#### Guidance

* Gray out any unavailable options
* Avoid very long dropdowns
* Avoid dropdown boxes when typing may be faster
* support keyboard input
