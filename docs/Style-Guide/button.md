Use buttons for the most important actions you want users to take on your site, such as "download," "sign up," or "log out."

#### Interaction
Primary button gets the focus prior to a secondary button. Initially the keyboard focus is on the primary button. Thus users may hit the enter key to trigger the primary button to close a dialog for example without using the mouse. In this case the system should provide a non-destructive solution.

#### Context and usage
The primary button indicates the primary action in the current interface and animates the user to click it.
There should only be one main action per interface area, e.g. per dialog. All other buttons should be of type secondary or tertiary button.

#### When to consider something else
If you want to lead users between pages of a website. Use links instead.
Less popular or less important actions may be visually styled as links.

#### Guidance
* Generally, use primary buttons for actions that go to the next step and use secondary buttons for actions that happen on the current page.
* Style the button most users should click in a way that distinguishes from other buttons on the page. Try using the “large button” or the most visually distinct fill color.
* Make sure buttons should look clickable—use color variations to distinguish static, hover and active states.
* Avoid using too many buttons on a page.
* Use sentence case for button labels.
* Button labels should be as short as possible with “trigger words” that your users will recognize to clearly explain what will happen when the button is clicked (for example, “download,” “view” or “sign up”).
* Make the first word of the button’s label a verb. For example, instead of “Complaint Filing” label the button “File a complaint.”
* At times, consider adding an icon to signal specific actions (“download”, “open in a new window”, etc).
