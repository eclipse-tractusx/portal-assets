# Intro

<br>

The registration process includes the onboarding of an organization. A natural person does not need an onboarding in Catena-X.
<br>
<br>
The registration process of an organization involves a person belonging to the organization and who is authorized acting on behalf of the organization.

Pre-condition: The authorized organization onboarding party must have received a Catena-X invite and needs to have valid documents of the organization (e.g. commercial register excerpt, certifications).

#### Registration Login

After receiving the CX invite email (incl. registration login URL and one-time-password), the user can directly start the login to the company registration.

### Registration Login Details

With the login of the user to the registration, first the application record with status is getting loaded via the portal db.
Based on the fetched status; the frontend logic will decide how the user proceeds.  
<br>

1. If the status is any status before "SUBMITTED" (< id "7"); the company registration form gets displayed; starting with the introduction screen.  
   If company registration data have been previously added/saved already, the data will be displayed inside the registration form; otherwise an empty registration form will be displayed.
2. If the status is in status "SUBMITTED" (= id "7"); the information screen "application in validation" screen is getting displayed.

3. If the status is in status "APPROVED" (= id "8"); the user should get redirected to the portal "home" page

4. If the status is in status "DECLINED" (= id "9"); the information screen "application declined and closed" screen is getting displayed
