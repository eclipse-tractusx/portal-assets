<br>
In Step 4, the users are asked to upload the company identification.
<br>
All documents uploaded under the same application register form are shown. If a second user has already uploaded a doc, the user will be able to see as well as delete this document as well; as long as the users belong to the same company application.

#### API Details

##### #1 API Get Documents

Fetching documents already loaded by a company assigned user which is connected to the current application.  
<br>

```diff
! GET /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

<br>
<br>

##### #2 API Upload Document

Documents are uploaded into the portal.document table and are connected via the user_id and document_type to the respective application.  
<br>

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

<br>
<br>

##### #3 API Delete Document

Documents can get deleted as long as the documents are still in the right/respective status.  
<br>

```diff
! DELETE /api/registration/documents/{documentId}
```

<br>
<br>
Important: only documents under the same application are deletable. Additional the application needs to be in any status beside submitted; approved and declined.
