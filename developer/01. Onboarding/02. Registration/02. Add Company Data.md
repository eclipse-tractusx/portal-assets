In step 1 of the registration application, the company administrator need to add the legal company details. 2 Options are available

* a) via BPN search and automatic data load

* b) adding the data manually
  * Legal Entity Name
  * Registration Name
  * Legal Entity Street
  * House Number
  * Postal Code
  * City
  * Country
  * Region (depending on the country)
  * NEW Unique ID such as Handelsregister, Tax ID, etc.

## Implementation View

### Enter Company Data

#### a) via BPN search and automatic data load

```diff
! GET /api/registration/legalEntityAddress/{bpn}
```

The endpoint is fetching the company data (if existing) from the bpdm data pool.
Portal backend transfers the bpdm data pool response for the protal FE to display all relevant information. (similar structure as the portal db GET response)

#### b) manually entered

Beside the offered autofill option via BPN, the user can also manually enter the legal company data.
In this scenario, the bpn stays empty, since its expected that the company doesnt have a bpn yet or isnt aware about the owned bpn.

In the scenario of manually entering the data, validations (as defined below) are covered.
Additionally to the validations, the unique identifier is getting is relevant and need to get entered by the company administrator based on the enetered legal entity country.  
Details to the unique identifier can get found in the following section [unique identifier logic](#unique-identifier)

##### Unique Identifier

The company unique identifier is a company specific identifier which is used to help companies to prove their identity. In Catena-X registration party needs to add minimum one unqiue identifier which is later used inside the application verification flow to identifier the companies identity.
To support the user entry and ensure that human errors are reduced, an endpoint to fetch the allowed unique identifier (per country) as well as field input validations are implemented.
<br>

###### Logic implemented for the country specific identifier

The unique identifier is a location based attribute; means, after the user entered a country code; the FE needs to fetch the possible company identifier via an api call an display them inside the new FE dropdown field (see details below)

initially when opening the registration form step 1 "company data"; the unique identifier section is not displayed.
Only when entering the country code; the unique id section is getting displayed (see screen below)

```dif
! GET /api/registration/company/country/{alpha2Code}/uniqueidentifiers
```

<br>

Response Body

		[
		  {
		    "id": 1,
		    "label": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER"
		  },
		  {
		    "id": 2,
		    "label": "VAT_ID"
		  }
		]

<br>

**NOTE**
Unique identifier handling
3 possible scenarios; when receiving the company data via the the bpdm autofill scenario

* no unique identifier
* only one unique identifier (happy path)
* multiple identifier
 
#A - no unique identifier
Same as the manual flow => user needs to select the unique identifier type and enter the id

#B - only one unique identifier (happy path)
The ID is getting auto displayed and can not get changed by the user

#C - multiple identifier
In case that multiple identifier are submitted, the user needs to be able to select the preferred used identifier.  
<br>

Below you can find an example of the implemented design for "multiple identifier"

###### Implemented Pattern

<br>
<br>


###### POST allowed Unique Identifier

no post call existing. The data will get stored as part of the POST /companyDetailsWithAddress endpoint

<br>
<br>

### Store/Save Company Data

To store the added company data in the portal db (no matter if they have been added manually or via bpn search) the POST endpoint is triggered with the user selection of the "Confirm" button on the buttom of the form.

<br>

```diff
! POST /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
```

<br>

Response Body

		{
		  "companyId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
		  "name": "string",
		  "city": "string",
		  "streetName": "string",
		  "countryAlpha2Code": "string",
		  "bpn": "string",
		  "shortName": "string",
		  "region": "string",
		  "streetAdditional": "string",
		  "streetNumber": "string",
		  "zipCode": "string",
		  "countryDe": "string",
		  "uniqueIds": [
		    {
		      "type": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER",
		      "value": "string"
		    }
		  ]
		}


<br>
<br>

### Display Company Data (pre-saved)

In case the user has previously added company data already or used the bpn autofill option and saved the autfilled data, the registration app will display the respective company data by fetching them via the GET endpoint from the portal db

```diff
! GET /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
```

<br>

Response Body

		{
		  "companyId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
		  "name": "string",
		  "city": "string",
		  "streetName": "string",
		  "countryAlpha2Code": "string",
		  "bpn": "string",
		  "shortName": "string",
		  "region": "string",
		  "streetAdditional": "string",
		  "streetNumber": "string",
		  "zipCode": "string",
		  "countryDe": "string",
		  "uniqueIds": [
		    {
		      "type": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER",
		      "value": "string"
		    }
		  ]
		}
