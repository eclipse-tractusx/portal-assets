* isOwner provides the information of the technical user is managed by another company for the acting company. Example: Company A has a managed EDC subscribed. The managed EDC provider creates in the name of Company A an technical user to connect the managed EDC to the dataspace. For Company B the technical user will be displayed as "isOwned: false" since the user is managed by the service provider but exist in the name of/for Company A.
* in case the technical user is not connected to any app/service - the "offer" section will be empty
