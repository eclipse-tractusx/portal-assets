### #2 Update App Role

Update user roles works with an easy method. FE provides all role assignments via the endpoint request body.  
The backend will use this input and freshly reset the user assigned user roles. With this mechanism, the endpoint can get used for assignment as well as unassignment of roles in the same manner.

Validation:

- active app subscription must be existing
- client must be existing
- company user needs to belong to the same company

```diff
! PUT api/administration/user/{companyUserId}/app/{appId}/roles
```

Request body
