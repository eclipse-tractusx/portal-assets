## Summary

App Providers can adjust the app lead image via the "App Overview" page.
The change has direct impact on the app card displayed on the marketplace as well as the app detail page and other connected pages where the lead image is fetched.
Please note that a delay of displaying the new lead image could appear, in case a longer cache hold of the image is configured.

## Implementation

```diff
POST /api/apps/AppChange/{appId}/appLeadImage
```

<br>

Request Body

    image file - png/jpeg

<br>

#### Validation:

- only png and jpeg are allowed
- the user can only update the image; if the user assigned company_id is the same as the app/offer provider_company_id
- app status = "ACTIVE"

#### Logic:

- if all pre-requisites/validations are met, the document is getting stored in the portal.documents table
- link between the document and the app/offer is created in table portal.offer_assigned_documents
- previous leadImage status is changed from "LOCKED" to "INACTIVE" in table portal.documents
