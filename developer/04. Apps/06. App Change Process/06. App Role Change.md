### Implementation

#### GEt app roles

```diff
GET /api/administration/user/owncompany/roles/apps/{appId}
```

<br>

Request Body

    {
      "offerId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
      "roles": [
        {
          "roleId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
          "role": "string",
          "description": "string"
        }
      ]
    }

<br>

<br>
<br>

#### Add new roles

```diff
POST /api/apps/AppChange/{appId}/role/activeapp
```

<br>

Request Body

    [ [
      {
        "role": "string",
        "descriptions": [
          {
            "languageCode": "string",
            "description": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    

<br>

#### Validation:

* only csv file type is allowed
* user assigned company needs to be the offer provider company
* app status = "ACTIVE"
 

#### Logic:

* if all pre-requisites/validations are met, the document is getting stored in the portal.documents table
* link between the document and the app/offer is created in table portal.offer_assigned_documents
* previous leadImage status is changed from "LOCKED" to "INACTIVE" in table portal.documents
