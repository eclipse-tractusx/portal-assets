## App Subscription Activation
<br>
<br>

To activate a customer subscription request, the /autosetup endpoint is provided to autosetup the app client, create relevant technical users and activate the app for the customer.
<br>
The activation will allow the customer company to assign the app user roles to existing user accounts. With the assigned roles, the respective users will find the app inside the "My Business App" feature on the home page.
=> details to "My Business Apps" can be found [here](/docs/04.%20App(s)/01.%20Marketplace/04.%20My%20Business%20Apps.md)

## Implementation

<br>

### Activation Overlay

</p>
<br>

In case of an error in the url, due to missing https:// tag or invalid url format - the input field will display the error to the user:
<br>

</p>
<br>

<br>

To be able to display all the necessary content of the overlay, additionally the endpoint GET: /api/apps/{appId}/appreleaseprocess/technical-user-profiles need to get fetched to retrieve the app technical user profile.

<br>
<br>

### Activation & Success

The app subscription activation is used to activate the customer app tenant. The endpoint can only get triggered if the app subscription is in status "PENDING".  
By entering the tenant url, the client is getting registered inside the portal db and the catena-x idp.

```diff
POST: /api/apps/autoSetup

{
  "requestId": "uuid - subscriptionId",
  "offerUrl": "string"
} 

```

<br>

Business Logic:
* create app instance / client in central idp to enable tenant authentication/authorization
* create app_subscription_details record with customer app tenant url
* store app instance / client details inside the portal db
* update the status of the 'company x appId' record insight the table offer_subscriptions to "ACTIVE"

<br>

##### Data Mapping:

* requestId: {subscriptionId}
* offerUrl: user added tenant url

<br>

> **_NOTE:_**  The endpoint POST: /api/apps/autoSetup can only get triggered by the app owner and if the app subscription record is in state "PENDING"
> With the endpoint run, the technical user is created as well as the app tenant inside the portal db and the keycloak instance

<br>

    "clientId": "string",
    "clientUrl": "string"

* clientUrl: {URL}
* technicalUserPermissions: {technicalUserType}
