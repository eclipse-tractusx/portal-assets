## Implementation 

### #1 POST Subscribe Request

The post subscribe request is triggered by the customer / interested company via the app marketplace "Subscribe" function.
The request triggers a request to the app provider (via portal notifications and email).
Via the subscribe request service, the app provider gets informed about the raised customer interest and can take the following actions to activate the app usage.
<br>

Business Logic:
With the POST api, the backend service will
* create a record inside the company_assigned_apps table
* status_id for the record will get set to "PENDING"

<br>

```diff
! POST /api/apps/{appId}/subscribe
```

<br>
<br>

### #2 Manage (own) App Subscription
Get Subscription Customer Endpoint is used to receive all the subscriptions which the company has subscribed for.

Subscriptions with status PENDING, ACTIVE and INACTIVE will get distracted.

<br>

```diff
! GET /api/apps/subscribed/subscription-status
```

<br>
<br>

### #3 Manage App Subscriptions
Get Subscription Provider Endpoint is used to receive all subscriptions or subscription requests of my offered apps.

Subscriptions with status PENDING, ACTIVE and INACTIVE will get distracted.

<br>

```diff
! GET /api/apps/provided/subscription-status
```

<br>
<br>

### #4 Put Inactivate App Subscriptions
