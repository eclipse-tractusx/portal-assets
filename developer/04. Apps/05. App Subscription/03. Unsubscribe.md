### Implementation 

#### #1 PUT Unsubscribe

The subsciption customer (offer_subscriptions.company_id) is able to unsubscribe from an app.
<br>

Business Logic:
With the PUT api, the backend service will
* set linked "connector" instances to "DELETED"
* set the SD document of the "connector" to "DELETED"
* set linked "technical user" to "DELETED"
* last but not least the connector instance itselfe managed in portal table connectors is getting set to "INACTIVE" which is similar like an "DELETE"

Validation:
* user can only unsubscribe subscriptions where the user assigned company is subscription holder/owner
* only subscriptions in status "ACTIVE" can get set to "INACTIV"E - other status subscriptions will result in an error "Subscription in wrong status. Action not possible."
