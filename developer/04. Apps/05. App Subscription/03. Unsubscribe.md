<br>

Implementation details:

* [ ] when the user clicks the "unsubscribe" button, an overlay gets displayed
* [ ] inside the overlay details of subscription connections are displayed
* [ ] information to display subscription connections are fetched via GET: /api/apps/{appId}/subscription/{subscriptionId}/subscriber
* [ ] user can select checklist item "Yes I agree that I understood the unsubscribe impact and want to proceed with the process."
* [ ] with clicking/agreeing to the checklist item, the "Unsubscribe" button is active
* [ ] when clicking the "unsubscribe" button, the endpoint PUT /api/Apps/{subscriptionId}/unsubscribe is triggered
* [ ] until endpoint response is available, the button will display the load icon and is not re-clickable
* [ ] in case the endpoint /unsubscribe fails - display the error and keep the cancel overlay displayed to the user 
* [ ] in case the endpoint /unsubscribe is successful - close the overlay and show a success notification. Also reload the page to ensure that the app subscription section is up-to-date

#### #1 GET Subscribed Apps

Retrieves all app subscriptions of the user acting company.
<br>

##### Business Logic:  

* only responsed with active subscriptions

<br>

##### Validation:

* app id must be existing (no matter in which status)
* subscriptionId must be existing and assigned 

<br>

```diff
! GET: /api/apps/subscribed/activesubscriptions
```

<br>

Response Body

    {
      "offerId": "uuid",
      "name": "string - app name",
      "provider": "string - company name",
      "image": "uuid",
      "subscriptionId": "uuid"
    }

<br>
<br>

#### #2 GET Subscription Details

Fetches the app subscriptions details incl. possible linked tech user and connector id.
<br>

##### Business Logic:  

* based on the subscriptionId check linked technical user and connectors and include the same in the response body
  * based on the subscriptionId look-up the possible linked connector ID via table portal.connector_assigned_offer_subscriptions. If an connector ID is found, get via the connector ID and table portal.connectors all related connector data
  * 

<br>

##### Validation:

* app id must be existing (no matter in which status)
* subscriptionId must be existing and assigned 

<br>

```diff

```

#### #3 PUT Unsubscribe

The subsciption customer (offer_subscriptions.company_id) is able to unsubscribe from an app.
<br>

##### Business Logic:  
With the PUT api, the backend service will
* set linked "connector" instances to "DELETED"
* set the SD document of the "connector" to "DELETED"
* set linked "technical user" to "DELETED"
* last but not least the subscription record itselfe gets updated to "INACTIVE"

##### Validation:
* user can only unsubscribe subscriptions where the user assigned company is subscription holder/owner
* only subscriptions in status "ACTIVE" can get set to "INACTIV"E - other status subscriptions will result in an error "Subscription in wrong status. Action not possible."

<br>

```diff
! PUT /api/Apps/{subscriptionId}/unsubscribe
```
