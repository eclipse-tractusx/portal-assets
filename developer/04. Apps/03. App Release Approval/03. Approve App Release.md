### #1 Approve App Release

The approve app release function is used to release an app which is in status "In Review" to the marketplace.

With the approval the status of the app is getting updated to "ACTIVE" and the app provider (app manager) is getting informed about the successful release.
<br>

```diff
! PUT /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/approveApp
```

<br>

With the approval of the app, the releaseDate is getting set => offers.released_date
