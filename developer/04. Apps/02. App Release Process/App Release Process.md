## Summary

The "App Release Publishing Process" is accessible via the "App Release Process" as well as the "App Management".  
<br>
The App Provider has access to both of the start screens to trigger a new app for marketplace publishing.  
<br>
The app publishing process includes the submission of relevant app details, adding app images, documents as well as testing and technical connection (where suitable).

## Implementation

#### Trigger the Publishing Process

Option 1: Via the app management page

In the Step 1 of the publishing process, the app card details are getting filled first

- app name
- provider
- app lead picture
- language support
- pricing information
- etc.

##### Implementation Details

- create a new app in table portal.apps with the data send in the request body
  - store the value "title" in the attribute name
  - store the value "provider" in the attribute provider
  - store the value "leadPictureUri" in the attribute thumbnail_url
  - the status of the app is getting set to "CREATED" => "1"
- portal.apps attribute provider_company_id is set based on the users company id
- the "descriptions" in de and en are stored in the table portal.app_descriptions (linked to the table portal.apps via the new created app id)
- the "supportedLanguageCodes" are stored in the table portal.app_languages (linked to the table portal.apps via the new created app id)
- the "useCaseIds" (supported app use_case(s)) are stored in the portal.app_assigned_use_cases table (linked to the table portal.apps via the new created app id)
- the "price" is stored in the portal.app_assigned_licenses table (linked to the table portal.apps via the new created app id)

<br>
<br>

##### API Details

Privacy Policy options/enums are fetched from the portal db to display the select option to the user.

```diff
! GET /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/privacyPolicies
```

<br>

    {
      "privacyPolicies": [
        "COMPANY_DATA"
      ]
    }

<br>

following translation for the privacy policy tags

| DB Response       | UI Tag Name     |

| "COMPANY_DATA“    | Company Data    |
| "USER_DATA“       | User Data       |
| "LOCATION"        | Location        |
| "BROWSER_HISTORY" | Browser History |
| "NONE"            | None            |

<br>

Design:

<img width="676" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/229377043-5572bcde-a84c-41de-a44e-0f8115539a83.png">

<br>

In case the privacy policies can not get loaded, the response will look like defined below:

<img width="658" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/229377086-7529cb89-4df4-442c-a531-13483c308554.png">

<br>
<br>

#### Step 3 - Terms & Conditions / Consent

<img width="576" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/223786562-6cc80a68-5299-4708-bc1d-1899dcf3cd23.png">

Depending on the response of the endpoint #1 GET agreements, the user will be enabled to download related documents from the portal to read through the relevant agreement details. Expected formats are pdf, however other formats can get supported as well.

<br>

###### #1 Retrieve Terms & Conditions

Terms and Conditions are fetched via the endpoint

```diff
! GET: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/agreementData
```

<br>

Response Body

    [
      {
        "agreementId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
        "name": "string",
        "documentId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6"
      }
    ]

<br>

Style

If documentId inside response body is != NULL display the respective agreement as link - example:

<img width="591" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/227883098-1043fd68-3461-4318-9c02-bbddf9ca8719.png">

<br>

If the documentId is NULL, the agreement is displayed without link (as currently implemented) - example:

<img width="590" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/227883308-8d933e1f-7b57-4bb4-a67d-4aed662c6d21.png">

<br>
<br>

###### #2 Retrieve Documents

Terms and Conditions with an document ID in API endpoint #1 can get retrieved via the document endpoint GET /frameDocuments/{documentId}

```diff
Get: /api/administration/documents/frameDocuments/{documentId}
```

<br>

Response Body

    document file

<br>
<br>

###### #3 Upload Document

The user has to upload the app conformity document.

```diff
! PUT: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/updateappdoc/{appId}/documentType/{documentTypeId}/documents
```

Type: CONFORMITY_APPROVAL_BUSINESS_APPS

<br>

###### #4 DELETE Document

In case the user identifiers that a wrong document got uploaded in the respective step, the DELETE endpoint is used to delete doucments linked to the app.
Important: the deletion is not reversable - since the app is still under DRAFT, all app related details will get deleted immediately.

```diff
! Delete: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/documents/{documentId}
```

<br>
<br>

#### Step 4 - Integration - Role Upload

<br>

<p align="center">
<img width="464" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/223825655-10abc8f9-815e-4bb2-9c4a-33347e763716.png">
</p>

The Role Upload is a mandatory app release process step where the app provider can upload a csv file (template attached) to load user roles and description.
With uploading the csv via the dropzone, a preview section will display the respective roles to be uploaded.

<p align="center">
<img width="464" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/223828948-02846247-2389-4d45-8d93-95c71dba4e01.png">
</p>
 
With approving the upload with the button "Create App Roles" the roles are stored in the portal DB. Keycloak is untouched, since role creation in keycloak will only be relevant if the app instance/client is getting created.

<br>
<br>

##### API Details

###### #1 Upload Roles

```diff
! POST /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/role
```

<br>

Request Body

    [
      {
        "role": "string",
        "descriptions": [
          {
            "languageCode": "string",
            "description": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

<br>
<br>

###### #2 Delete Roles

```diff
! DELETE: /api/apps/appreleaseprocess/{appId}/role/{roleId}
```

<br>
<br>

#### Step 5 - Beta Test Runs
