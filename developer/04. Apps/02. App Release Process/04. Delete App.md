## Summary

As part of the app release process; the user needs to get enabled to delete the app which is currently in the create process.
<br>
For the need of the draft app deletio, the "App Deletion - App under App Release Process" got enabled.
<br>


## Implementation

### Delete App

##### Validation

* check if user is allowed to delete the app (by taking the user token and check the company_user.company_id). The company_id must be the same as the app related company id (offers.provider_company_id)
* validate if the app is in status "CREATED" if not; error about the incorrect status to be send back
 

##### Logic:

* when deletion is triggered and all pre-requisites are met, delete the following app data in the table:
  * portal.offers
  * portal.offer_assigned_documents
  * portal.offer_assigned_licenses
  * portal.offer_assigned_privacy_policies
  * portal.documents
  * portal.document_assigned_offers
  * portal.app_assigned_use_cases
  * portal.app_languages
  * portal.offer_tags
  * portal.offer_description
 

Please note; the documents are not yet in LOCKED state; that means they can get fully deleted from the table; no need to set them to status "INACTIVE"
