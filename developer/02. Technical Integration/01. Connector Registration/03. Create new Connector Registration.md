## 1. Create new Connector Registration - self-owned

<br>
<img width="1267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/catenax-ng/tx-portal-assets/assets/94133633/4f3056d5-a2a3-4dc5-8225-aaf4db5a04dc">
<br>
<br>

The user can create a new connector registration by using the connector POST call.
<br>
The registration will automatically
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".

<br>
<br>

#### Details to the SD

The self description factory is getting triggered as part of the connector registration.
The asynchronous interface is connected to the SD Factory which triggers the Clearinghouse Compliance Service; the Clearinghouse is validating the SD, signing and sends back the Self Description to the portal.
<br>

##### #1 Self description request

Request body (refinement still needed):

```json
{
    "externalId": "connectorId"
    "type": "LegalPerson or ServiceOffering",
    "providedBy": "string",
    "aggregationOf": "string"?,
    "termsAndConditions": "string?",
    "policies": "string",
    "issuer": "string",
    "holder": "string"
}
```

<br>

##### #2 Self description response (asynchronous)

Request body (refinement still needed):

```json
{
  "externalId":"connectorId",
  "status":"CONFIRM or FAILED",
  "message":"string",
  "content": "string"
}
```

<br>

Execution:

In case of status "success"
* content is stored as json file inside the portal db
* connector status:
  * Active - if the sd_document_id is != NULL set the connector status to "ACTIVE"
  * Pending - if the sd_document_id is = NULL

<br>

In case of status "fail"
* set status of the "Self_Description_SO" to "FAILED" and store the message inside the checklist comment field application_checklist.comment

>Connector Name
>- length: min 2; max 20

>Connector Owner
>- BPNL's are allowed only. User need to add the BPNL. Validation needed that the input is exact 16 digits and starts with "BPNL"
>
>Authentication
>- only allows .pem and .cert files
<br>
<br>

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* fetch via the company_user_id the company id which is used has host and provider of the edc
* input data as well as the backend fetched company id's are send to the SD factory to create the connector self-description with connection to the wallet
* after successful self-description creation, the edc details as well as the self-description document are getting stored inside the portal database
* last the daps is getting triggered to register the connector inside the daps authentication service; in case the service fails; the user will get informed and needs to retrigger the daps
<br>
<br>

#### API Details

```diff
! POST /api/administration/Connectors
```

<br>

Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "connectorUrl": "string",
  "location": "string",
  "technicalUserId": "uuid",
}
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Optionally an technical user id can get provided when creating the connector. With that the technical user connected with the connector is technically linked inside the portal as well. This supports an easier technical user management for consumer as well as provider (db: connector.company_service_account_id). The technical user need to belong to the same company id and the status of the user must be "ACTIVE"

<br>
<br>

## 2. Create new Connector Registration - managed

<br>
<br>

Service Provider can create a new registration for a company which subscribed for a service provider service

Same as for self-owned connectors, the connector registration will automatically 
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".

<br>

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* use the company_user_id to retrieve the company_id
* validate if a service request is active between service provider company and to be registered connector company
* if record found, proceed
* if not, block and send back an error
