## 1. Create new Connector Registration - self-owned

<br>
<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94133633/217815649-14aa6281-81bc-480b-9bf3-dd6a8264b20c.png">
<br>
<br>

The user can create a new connector registration by using the connector POST call.
<br>
The registration will automatically
* register the connector in the daps authentication service (with the public key uploaded inside the connector registration UI / endpoint)
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>
<br>

#### Details to the DAPS

The connector registration job triggers the daps component to register the respective connector inside the daps.
Therefore the portal backend transforms the connector registration data and provides the needed information to the daps registration service.
Inside daps, the client for the respective connector is getting created and success message is getting responded back to the portal.

DAPS is not directly reachable. Due to security regulations, the DAPS registration service is wrapped by the portal endpoint.

##### API Details

```diff
! POST /daps
```

<br>

Request Body

```json
{
  "clientName":"string",
  "securityProfile":"BASE_SECURITY_PROFILE",
  "referringConnector": "connector.url+BPN (own connector: own bpn; managed connector: bpn of the provider)",
  "file": "string($binary)"
  }
```

Details

* clientName: Name of a client we create a record for
* securityProfile: Default value is idsc:BASE_SECURITY_PROFILE
* referringConnector: URL of a connector with BPN at the end (see details above)
* file: Certificate of a Connector in PEM format

<br>

<br>

With the success response from DAPS, the newly created DAPS clientID is getting provided back to the portal inside the response body. The portal stores the clientID inside the portal db to be able to trigger (if needed) the connector change or deletion in a later stage.

<br>

#### Details to the SD

The self description factory is getting triggered as part of the connector registration.
The asynchronous interface is connected to the SD Factory which triggers the Clearinghouse Compliance Service; the Clearinghouse is validating the SD, signing and sends back the Self Description to the portal.
<br>

##### #1 Self description request

Request body (refinement still needed):

```json
{
    "externalId": "connectorId"
    "type": "LegalPerson or ServiceOffering",
    "providedBy": "string",
    "aggregationOf": "string"?,
    "termsAndConditions": "string?",
    "policies": "string",
    "issuer": "string",
    "holder": "string"
}
```

<br>

##### #2 Self description response (asynchronous)

Request body (refinement still needed):

```json
{
  "externalId":"connectorId",
  "status":"CONFIRM or FAILED",
  "message":"string",
  "content": "string"
}
```

<br>

Execution:

In case of status "success"
* content is stored as json file inside the portal db
* connector status:
  * Active - if the daps auth has status "true" set the connector status to "ACTIVE"
  * Pending - if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "false" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL
  * Pending - if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "false" and connector.self_description_document_id is = NULL
  * Pending - if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is = NULL

<br>

In case of status "fail"
* set status of the "Self_Description_SO" to "FAILED" and store the message inside the checklist comment field application_checklist.comment

<br>

Technical explanation: if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL; connector status is "ACTIVE"

<br>
<br>

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* fetch via the company_user_id the company id which is used has host and provider of the edc
* input data as well as the backend fetched company id's are send to the SD factory to create the connector self-description with connection to the wallet
* after successful self-description creation, the edc details as well as the self-description document are getting stored inside the portal database
* last the daps is getting triggered to register the connector inside the daps authentication service; in case the service fails; the user will get informed and needs to retrigger the daps
<br>
<br>

#### API Details

```diff
! POST /api/administration/Connectors
```

<br>

Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "connectorUrl": "string",
  "location": "string",
  "technicalUserId": "uuid",
}
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Optionally an technical user id can get provided when creating the connector. With that the technical user connected with the connector is technically linked inside the portal as well. This supports an easier technical user management for consumer as well as provider (db: connector.company_service_account_id). The technical user need to belong to the same company id and the status of the user must be "ACTIVE"

<br>
<br>

## 2. Create new Connector Registration - managed

Service Provider can create a new registration for a company which subscribed for a service provider service

Same as for self-owned connectors, the connector registration will automatically 
* register the connector in the daps authentication service (with the public key uploaded inside the connector registration UI / endpoint)
* trigger the SD Factory to create the self-description of the connector

<br>

If connector data have been successfully stored; DAPS auth has been successful and SD is created and stored; the connector record will receive the status "ACTIVE".
Technical explanation: if the connector.daps_registration_successful is "true" and connector.self_description_document_id is != NULL; connector status is "ACTIVE"

<br>

#### Logical flow of the service

* fetch the user id from the user token calling the POST call
* from the user token user_id get via the table iam_user the company_user_id
* use the company_user_id to retrieve the company_id
* validate if a service request is active between service provider company and to be registered connector company
* if record found, proceed
* if not, block and send back an error
