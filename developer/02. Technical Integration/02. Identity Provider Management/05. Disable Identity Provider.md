Active IdPs can get disabled to later delete them.
IdP disablement is only possible from IdP owners in a managed or own scenario.
The disablement of IdPs supports the user to delete the IdP in a later stage.

#### Implementation details:

* [ ] "Disable IdP" is available in the "Action" sub-menu
* [ ] "Disable IdP" is only available if minimum 2 IdPs have the status enabled: true; otherwise the "Disable IdP" functionality is deactivated and can not get triggered
* [ ] when clicking on "Disable IdP" the endpoint to disable the IdP (already implemented) is running, till the disable process was successful we should ideally see a "load" icon inside the sub-menu
* [ ] if the idp disable is successful, the respective information "IdP got disabled" is displayed on the top right and auto closes after 5 seconds (see design below)
* [ ] if the idp disable is unsuccessful, same as for the success the error is getting displayed on the top right; with the message "Something went wrong. IdP got not disabled."
* [ ] idps which are completely configured but deactivated get the status and progress "disabled" (see details below)
