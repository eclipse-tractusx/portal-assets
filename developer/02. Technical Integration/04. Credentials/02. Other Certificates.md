Running certificate requests as well as inactive and active certificates are displayed inside the page.

```diff
! GET /api/administration/companydata/certificates
```

<br>

Response Body

    [
      {
        "credentialType": "e.g. DISMANTLER_CERTIFICATE",
        "ssiDetailData": [
          {
            "credentialId": "uuid",
            "participationStatus": "e.g. PENDING",
            "expiryDate": "date",
            "document": {
              "documentId": "uuid",
              "documentName": "string"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

<br>
<br>

### Available Certificate Document Requests

With the page load, the GET /certificateTypes endpoint is triggered which gets used to manage the "Upload Certificate" Button as well as the overlay content.
The endpoint only response with those certificate types which the user company can actually request.

Backend Logic:

- get all generally available/supported certificate types
- subtract those certificate types, where an PENDING or ACTIVE credential does exist

<br>

> **_NOTE:_** Soon it is planned to support the credential renewal

##### Additional implementation details

[x] if the api response is empty, no certificate can get uploaded - in this case the upload button should be inactive

<br>

[x] for the credential request overlay: the certificate type dropdown is only active, if more then just one certificate type is received via the GET /certificateTypes endpoint

[x] for the credential request overlay: if only one certificate file is available, the dropdown is deactivated and the certificate type is prefilled

<br>
<br>

### Submit Certificate request

As part of the credential request submission (which is only possible if there is no PENDING request for the credential and version existing yet) the signed framework agreement need to get submitted.

```diff
! POST /api/administration/companydata/certificates
```

<br>

Request Body

      "credentialType": "string from the GET call",
      "document": "document file (only pdf are allowed)"
    }
