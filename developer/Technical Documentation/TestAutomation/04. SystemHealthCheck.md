# System Health Check

Before functional e2e tests will run, system health check runs parallel to interface health check in order to check that
static data are loaded.
These tests run with portal user for non-technical tests and are now implemented for:

* [System Health Check for Administration Service](#system-health-check-for-administration-service)
* [DB / API Tests for Registration Service](#db--api-test-for-registration-service)
