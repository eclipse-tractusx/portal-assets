# Portal Health Check

Before functional e2e tests will run, portal health check runs parallel to interface health check in order to check that
static data is loaded.
These tests run with portal user for non-technical tests and are now cover two groups of checks:

- [Base Data Load Check for Administration Service](#base-data-load-check-for-administration-service)
- [Registration Health Check for Registration Service](#registration-health-check-for-registration-service)

## Base Data Load Check for Administration Service

GET: api/administration/user/owncompany/users
