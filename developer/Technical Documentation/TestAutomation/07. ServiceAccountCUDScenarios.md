# Service Account CUD Scenarios

These scenarios suppose to check if new service accounts can be correctly created, updated and deleted. As service
accounts always need to get a permission assigned, the permission for these tests is defined in test data file for
ServiceAccountCUDScenarios and is "BPDM Pool" for now. The UUID of this permission is fetched via:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/user/roles
```

These scenarios run sequentially. After run of all scenarios the newly created service accounts are deleted.

## Create a new service account

This scenario checks if a new service account can be created correctly.

To do this, first a list of existing accounts is requested via:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Next a new service account is created:

```
POST: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

with body (same structure for other scenarios):

```

{
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "authenticationType": "SECRET",
    "roleIds": [
        "UUID_OF_PERMISSION"
    ]
}
```

To ensure that the new service account is created correctly, current list of existing accounts is requested and it is
validated if new service account is not a part of the first list, but the part of the second one.

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Finally [a token for the created technical user](../../03.%20User%20Management/03.%20Technical%20User/05.%20FAQ.md) is
fetched and it is validated if the token includes an attribute "bpn".

## Create a new service account and update the same

This scenario checks if a new service account can be created correctly and if the name and the description of this
account can be updated.

To do this, a new service account is created:

```
POST: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Then details of this account are updated by changing name and description:

```
PUT: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}
```

Afterwards it is checked if the change of the service account details got successfully saved:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

## Create a new service account and update the credentials

This scenario checks if a new service account can be created correctly and if credentials for this account can be reset.

To do this, a new service account is created:

```
POST: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Then credentials of the created service account are reset:

```
POST: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}/resetCredentials
```

Afterwards it is checked if the resetup of credentials was successful:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Finally [a token for the created technical user](../../03.%20User%20Management/03.%20Technical%20User/05.%20FAQ.md) with
the new credentials is fetched and it is checked that old credentials are not valid anymore.

## Create and delete a new service account

This scenario checks if a new service account can be created and afterwards deleted correctly.

First a new service account is created:

```
POST: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Afterward it will be checked if the new service account is available:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```

Then the created service account is deleted:

```
DELETE: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts/{serviceAccountId}
```

Afterwards it is checked that the deleted service account is not available anymore:

```
GET: api/administration/serviceaccount/owncompany/serviceaccounts
```
