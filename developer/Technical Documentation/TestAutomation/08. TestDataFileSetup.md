# Test data file setup

There are two types of test data files used. One is for registration scenarios, second one is for service account CUD scenarios.
These files represent a list of json objects. If a new object is added into the list in the test file, test will run several times according to number of objects in the file. Now the structure of the objects for each scenario will be explained.


## Test data file for registration scenarios

### Scenario: Registration without Bpn

For registration without bpn company detail data, company roles, document type id and document name can be defined via test data file. The structure of the corresponding object looks as follows:

```
{
    "companyDetailData": {
        "companyId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
        "name": "Test-Catena-X",
        "city": "Munich",
        "streetName": "Main street",
        "countryAlpha2Code": "DE",
        "bpn": null,
        "shortName": "Test-Catena-X",
        "region": "Bayern",
        "streetAdditional": "Test",
        "streetNumber": "1",
        "zipCode": "12345",
        "countryDe": "Deutschland",
        "uniqueIds": [
            {
                "type": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER",
                "value": "HRB 12345"
            }
        ]
    },
    "companyRoles": [
        "ACTIVE_PARTICIPANT", "APP_PROVIDER"
        ],
    "documentTypeId": "COMMERCIAL_REGISTER_EXTRACT",
    "documentName": ""
}
```
Some notes: CompanyId from test data file is ignored as it is defined during invitation execution. For uniqueness of company names, during a test run a unique code consisting of the date and time of the test start is added to the values specified in the test file. So there is no need to care about uniqueness of company names and "Test-Catena-X" can be used in all data sets for this scenario.


### Scenario: Update company detail data

For update company detail data scenario company detail data and update copmpany detail data can be defined via test data file. The structure of the corresponding object looks as follows:


```
{
    "companyDetailData": {
      "companyId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "name": "Test-Catena-X",
      "city": "Munich",
      "streetName": "Main street",
      "countryAlpha2Code": "DE",
      "bpn": null,
      "shortName": "Test-Catena-X",
      "region": "Bayern",
      "streetAdditional": "Test",
      "streetNumber": "1",
      "zipCode": "12345",
      "countryDe": "Deutschland",
      "uniqueIds": [
        {
            "type": "COMMERCIAL_REG_NUMBER",
            "value": "HRB 12345"
        }
      ]
    },
    "updateCompanyDetailData": {
      "companyId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "name": "Test-Catena-X-Update",
      "city": "Munich",
      "streetName": "Main street update",
      "countryAlpha2Code": "DE",
      "bpn": null,
      "shortName": "Test-Catena-X",
      "region": "Bayern",
      "streetAdditional": "Test",
      "streetNumber": "12",
      "zipCode": "12345",
      "countryDe": "Deutschland",
      "uniqueIds": [
        {
            "type": "VAT_ID",
            "value": "DE123456789"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
Some notes: CompanyId from test data file is ignored as it is defined during invitation execution and stay the same for created and updated company detail data. The goal of the test is to check if the address and an another type of unique id can be updated correctly. So it makes sense to fill out the fields accordingly.

## Test data file for service account CUD scenarios

Test data file for service account CUD scenarios has now only one permission/role "BPDM Pool". If additional permissions are added to the list, the appropriate technical user will get additional permissions assigned. As explained earlier, additional objects with other roles can be added to the file in order to run the same scenario with different data sets.
```
{
"permissions": ["BPDM Pool"]
}
```
