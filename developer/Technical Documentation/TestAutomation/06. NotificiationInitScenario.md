# Notification initial scenario

This scenario checks if core user roles can be modified and runs with portal user for non-technical tests. Portal roles
are defined by NotificationOfferId which is specified in appsettings.EndToEndTests.json.
After getting an access token and company user id current portal roles for this portal user will be fetched from
response from the following endpoint:

```
GET: api/administration/user/owncompany/users/{companyUserId}
```

Available for defined NotificationOfferId core offer roles will be fetched from response from this endpoint:

```
GET: api/administration//user/owncompany/roles/coreoffers
```

Then a new random available role will be defined and the following endpoint will be triggered twice: first in order to
assign a random portal role to the user, then in order to unassign the same role. A 200 response is expected.

```
PUT: api/administration/user/owncompany/users/{companyUserId}/coreoffers/{offerId}/roles
```

Every time it will be checked if the notification with correct id type, added and removed roles for the appropriate user
was created:

```
GET: /api/notification/?page=0&size=10&sorting=DateDesc
```
