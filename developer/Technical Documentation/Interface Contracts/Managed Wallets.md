## Managed Wallets

<br>

### Interface Summary

Wallets are <strong>the touchpoint of company/participant to SSI as the digital identity</strong>. Companies can interact with other actors in the network using their own identity on their wallet.
Since SSI Wallets are not yet common on company level, Catena-X decided to create CX managed wallets for membership companies. This wallets can be used to enable the benefits of SSI for a number of services.
<br>
The Portal / Managed Service connection is implemented in 2 functions

- Company Registration - initial wallet creation
- EDC Registration - EDC Self-Description creation

<br>

### Description of the physical interfaces (HOW)

#### Wallet Creation & BPN VC

As part of the application/registration process, the portal triggers the managed identity wallet to create a new wallet tenant (with bpn).
In a later step (with the final activation of the company account) the membership credential is getting added.

The portal <-> miw communication is triggered by the checklist worker - however in case there should be troubles / issues with the worker - manual triggers are available as well:

- /api/administration/registration/application/{applicationId}/trigger-identity-wallet
- ..for the registration activation, no manual trigger is existing

Relevant endpoints from MIW side:

- POST /api/wallets
- POST /api/credentials/issuer/membership
