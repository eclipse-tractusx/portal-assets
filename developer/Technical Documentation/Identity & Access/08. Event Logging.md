# Event Logging

## Requirement

- [ ] Keycloak needs to log for each realm the login calls, logout, unsuccessful logins, changes of keycloak configs
- [ ] Date and time should get logged as well as the user which did the change
- [ ] Logs should not show any passwords in clear text
- [ ] Usernames should not show up in clear text, but need to be traceable
- [ ] When a new realm gets created, the log configuration needs to get configured automatically as per the requirement
- [ ] Log retention period 90days
<br>
<br>

## Keycloak events
Keycloak has two kinds of events:

* login events and
* admin events
<br>

Login events are emitted every time a user-related action around authentication is executed, e.g. login, logout, code-to-token exchanges, registrations, etc. Also errors of these actions are emitted as an event. The event itself then contains some useful information about the action and the corresponding user and/or client. Admin events are emitted on every change of a resource via the Admin-API, no matter if via the web console, REST api, CLI, etc.
<br>

It is possible to enable the Keycloak db to store the events. However this is not recommended, since the login events DB table is hardly indexed, the admin events table besides the PK not at all and querying lots of entries will likely slow down the system.  Also an important information regarding that: login event retention time can get configured; admin events retention time can't.
<br>

Keycloak has a default events listener (called jboss-logging) in each realm configured. When there is e.g. an error during a login attempt, this error event will be logged with log level WARN.
<br>

Successful events will be logged with level DEBUG and the root log level of the whole Keycloak server is set to INFO. With this setting, the SUCCESS-events won’t occur in the logs, only the ERROR-events will.
<br>
<br>

## Configure Logging
##### Keycloak Admin UI/DB
Login events occur for things like when a user logs in successfully, when somebody enters in a bad password, or when a user account is updated. Every single event that happens to a user can be recorded and viewed. By default, no events are stored or viewed in the Admin Console. Only error events are logged to the console and the server’s log file. To start persisting you’ll need to enable storage. Go to the Events left menu item and select the Config tab.
<br>

<br>


To start storing events you’ll need to turn the Save Events switch to on under the Login Events Settings.
<br>
<br>

###### Save Events

<br>


The Saved Types field allows you to specify which event types you want to store in the event store. The Clear events button allows you to delete all the events in the database. The Expiration field allows you to specify how long you want to keep events stored. Once you’ve enabled storage of login events and decided on your settings, don’t forget to click the Save button on the bottom of this page.
<br>

To view events, go to the Login Events tab.

###### Login Events

<br>

As you can see, there’s a lot of information stored and, if you are storing every event, there are a lot of events stored for each login action. The Filter button on this page allows you to filter which events you are actually interested in.

In this screenshot, we’re filtering only Login events. Clicking the Update button runs the filter.

###### Event Types
Login events:

* Login - A user has logged in.
* Register - A user has registered.
* Logout - A user has logged out.
* Code to Token - An application/client has exchanged a code for a token.
* Refresh Token - An application/client has refreshed a token.
<br>
<br>

Account events:

* Social Link - An account has been linked to a social provider.
* Remove Social Link - A social provider has been removed from an account.
* Update Email - The email address for an account has changed.
* Update Profile - The profile for an account has changed.
* Send Password Reset - A password reset email has been sent.
* Update Password - The password for an account has changed.
* Update TOTP - The TOTP settings for an account have changed.
* Remove TOTP - TOTP has been removed from an account.
* Send Verify Email - An email verification email has been sent.
* Verify Email - The email address for an account has been verified.

For all events there is a corresponding error event.

##### Log Files
	
Per default keycloak logs are configured to only log on INFO level, to get a detailed logging, the log level need to get updated.

2 options are available to adjust the logging level in the logs:

			Option1: Change the log level of the org.keycloak.events category logger
			With this approach, you add an entry in the logging subsystem of the underlying Wildfly configuration. The new entry tells the logging subsystem to print all log messages from the package org.keycloak.events with DEBUG level and above to the log output:

			/subsystem=logging/logger=org.keycloak.events/:add(category=org.keycloak.events,level=DEBUG)


			Option2: Configure the jboss-logging listener to log on other levels
			As per default, there is no eventsListener SPI config in the Keycloak server configuration. The default behaviour for the jboss-logging events listener is the one which is implemented in the code. To be able to change the configuration of the jboss-logging listener, you’ll have to create the proper SPI node in the keycloak-server subsystem first, then add the desired log levels.

			/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=eventsListener:add
			/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=eventsListener/provider=jboss-logging:add(enabled=true)
			/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=eventsListener/provider=jboss-logging:write-attribute(name=properties.success-level,value=info)
			/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=eventsListener/provider=jboss-logging:write-attribute(name=properties.error-level,value=warn)
			Now the SUCCESS-events will occur in the log output with level INFO, as soon as they are emitted by Keycloak.
<br>
<br>

## Event Listener
Event listeners listen for events and perform an action based on that event. There are two built-in listeners that come with Keycloak: Logging Event Listener and Email Event Listener.  
The Logging Event Listener writes to a log file whenever an error event occurs and is enabled by default. Here’s an example log message:
<br>

11:36:09,965 WARN  [org.keycloak.events] (default task-51) type=LOGIN_ERROR, realmId=master,
                    clientId=myapp,
                    userId=19aeb848-96fc-44f6-b0a3-59a17570d374, ipAddress=127.0.0.1,
                    error=invalid_user_credentials, auth_method=openid-connect, auth_type=code,
                    redirect_uri=http://localhost:8180/myapp,
                    code_id=b669da14-cdbb-41d0-b055-0810a0334607, username=admin
<br>

This logging is very useful if you want to use a tool like Fail2Ban to detect if there is a hacker bot somewhere that is trying to guess user passwords. You can parse the log file for LOGIN_ERROR and pull out the IP Address. Then feed this information into Fail2Ban so that it can help prevent attacks.  
<br>

The Email Event Listener sends an email to the user’s account when an event occurs. The Email Event Listener only supports the following events at the moment:

* Login Error
* Update Password
* Update TOTP
* Remove TOTP

<br>
<br>


To enable the Email Listener go to the Config tab and click on the Event Listeners field. This will show a drop down list box where you can select email.  
You can exclude one or more events by editing the standalone.xml, standalone-ha.xml, or domain.xml that comes with your distribution and adding for example:

		<spi name="eventsListener">

		  <provider name="email" enabled="true">

		     <properties>

		        <property name="exclude-events" value="[&quot;UPDATE_TOTP&quot;,&quot;REMOVE_TOTP&quot;]"/>

		     </properties>

		  </provider>

		</spi>
