## Security Generic

### Host

Keycloak uses the public hostname in several ways, such as within token issuer fields and URLs in password reset emails.

By default, the hostname derives from the request header. No validation exists to ensure a hostname is valid. Therefor its suggested to use a load balancer, or proxy, with Keycloak to prevent invalid host headers.

The hostname’s Service Provider Interface (SPI) provides a way to configure the hostname for requests. You can use this built-in provider to set a fixed URL for frontend requests while allowing backend requests based on the request URI. If the built-in provider does not have the required capability, you can develop a customized provider.

### Bruce Force Detection

A brute force attack happens when an attacker is trying to guess a user’s password multiple times. Keycloak has some limited brute force detection capabilities. If turned on, a user account will be temporarily disabled if a threshold of login failures is reached. To enable this feature go to the Realm Settings left menu item, click on the Security Defenses tab, then additional go to the Brute Force Detection sub-tab.

When an attack is detected, permanent or temporary lockout can get configured.

Permanent lockout disables a user account until an administrator re-enables it. Temporary lockout disables a user account for a specific period of time. The time period that the account is disabled increases as the attack continues.

When a user is temporarily locked and attempts to log in, {project_name} displays the default Invalid username or password error message. This message is the same error message as the message displayed for an invalid username or invalid password to ensure the attacker is unaware the account is disabled.

#### Catena-X configuration

##### Preventing automated attacks

- Lock after 10 subsequent login failures
- 1 second between failures (too quick for a human)
- Lock remains active for ~5 min

##### Preventing manual attacks

- Lock after 10 subsequent login failures
- Sliding window of 12 hours
- Lock remains active for ~ 45 min

### Clickjacking

Clickjacking is a technique of tricking users into clicking on a user interface element different from what users perceive. A malicious site loads the target site in a transparent iFrame, overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons placed directly under important buttons on the target site. When a user clicks a visible button, they are clicking a button on the hidden page. An attacker can steal a user’s authentication credentials and access their resources by using this method.

By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific browser headers that can prevent this from happening. Specifically, it sets X-FRAME_OPTIONS and Content-Security-Policy. You should take a look at the definition of both of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you can control.
Procedure

In the Admin Console, you can specify the values of the X-FRAME_OPTIONS and Content-Security-Policy headers.

1. Click the Realm Settings menu item.
2. Click the Security Defenses tab.

By default, Keycloak sets up a same-origin policy for iframes.

### Open redirections

An open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to automatically redirect a user agent to the location specified by the parameter value without validation. An attacker can use the end-user authorization endpoint and the redirect URI parameter to use the authorization server as an open redirector, using a user’s trust in an authorization server to launch a phishing attack.

Keycloak requires that all registered applications and clients register at least one redirection URI pattern. When a client requests that Keycloak performs a redirect, Keycloak checks the redirect URI against the list of valid registered URI patterns. Clients and applications must register as specific a URI pattern as possible to mitigate open redirector attacks.

### Compromised Authorization code

For the OIDC Auth Code Flow, Keycloak generates a cryptographically strong random value for its authorization codes. An authorization code is used only once to obtain an access token.

On the timeouts page in the Admin Console, you can specify the length of time an authorization code is valid. Its possible to configure the length of time for a client to request a token from the code.

You can also defend against leaked authorization codes by applying Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to clients.

### Compromised access and refresh tokens

Keycloak includes several actions to prevent malicious actors from stealing access tokens and refresh tokens. The crucial action is to enforce SSL/HTTPS communication between {project_name} and its clients and applications. {project_name} does not enable SSL by default.

Another action to mitigate damage from leaked access tokens is to shorten the token’s lifespans. You can specify token lifespans within the Realm Setting → Token. Short lifespans for access tokens force clients and applications to refresh their access tokens after a short time. If an admin detects a leak, the admin can log out all user sessions to invalidate these refresh tokens or set up a revocation policy.

In the current project phase, we will proceed with the default values for the token lifespans

### CSRF attack

A Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack uses HTTP requests from users that websites have already authenticated. Any site using cookie-based authentication is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. You can mitigate these attacks by matching a state cookie against a posted form or query parameter.

The OAuth 2.0 login specification requires that a state cookie matches against a transmitted state parameter. {project_name} fully implements this part of the specification, so all logins are protected.

The {project_name} Admin Console is a JavaScript/HTML5 application that makes REST calls to the backend {project_name} admin REST API. These calls all require bearer token authentication and consist of JavaScript Ajax calls, so CSRF is impossible. You can configure the admin REST API to validate the CORS origins.

The user account management section in {project_name} can be vulnerable to CSRF. To prevent CSRF attacks, {project_name} sets a state cookie and embeds the value of this cookie in hidden form fields or query parameters within action links. {project_name} checks the query/form parameter against the state cookie to verify that the user makes the call.

### Limiting Scope - Client Token

By default, new client applications have unlimited role scope mappings. Every access token for that client contains all permissions that the user has. If an attacker compromises the client and obtains the client’s access tokens, each system that the user can access is compromised.

Limit the roles of an access token by using the Scope menu for each client. Alternatively, you can set role scope mappings at the Client Scope level and assign Client Scopes to your client by using the Client Scope menu.

For any clients in CX, the scope is limited to the client scope.
