## Clients

### Overview Clients

Clients are entities that can request Keycloak to authenticate a user. Most often, clients are applications and services that want to use Keycloak to secure themselves and provide a single sign-on solution.

Clients can have 3 different client types

- public (For client-side clients that perform browser logins. As it is not possible to ensure that secrets can be kept safe with client-side clients, it is important to restrict access by configuring correct redirect URIs)
- confidential (For server-side clients that perform browser logins and require client secrets when making an Access Token Request. This setting should be used for server-side applications)
- bearer-only (The application allows only bearer token requests. When turned on, this application cannot participate in browser logins)

<br>
<br>

### Client Creation

clients are created with the portal & marketplace services:

- App Services
- Service Services

Manual creation of clients is not expected/needed

<br>
<br>

### Initial Client Load

In the initial system deployment/data load provided by the catena-x migration script, the relevant core clients are included.

### Client Authentication Concept

** example DFT / SDE **

The DFT (Data Format Transformer) is planned to get offered as a data provider essential services, hosted/operated by 3rd party service providers.

In the design of the authentication flow, it was analyzed which authentication flows are available and how do they differ.

<br>

Two main scenarios are possible and shown in the picture below

- One Central DFT Client Registration for all costumer
- Multiple Central DFT Client Registration, each customer one registration

</p>

<br>

In the chapter/details both scenarios are detailed.

##### Scenario 1 - Only one DFT Client - one for all customer

In the example of one DFT registrations for all customer, following tasks are necessary.

Whenever a new customer is approaching a service provider for a DFT instance, the service provider needs to request the enhancement of the allowed redirect URIs from the central portal instance.

Additionally, no additional effort is needed on the portal side.

For the authentication the result would look the following:

Below a picture is added with the user JWT token (used for authentication). Green highlighted the identical section and yellow highlighted the difference

<br>

Summary: in this scenario the difference of user of company 1 and user of company 2 is only the organisation and bpn tag. Everything else is identical and cant get used to ensure that users of company 1 are not able to access the dft instance of company 2.

Security: <strong>MEDIUM</strong>

<br>

##### Scenario 2 - Multiple DFT Clients - one for each customer

Instead of Scenario 1 "one app registration for all tenants" - Scenario 2 is focusing on a tenant-specific authorization setup. With that, the operator of the app can distinguish the assigned roles on a tenant basis. In the following figure, you can see that there is a specific section of roles for each tenant. With this setup, a user can only access the tenant to which he actually has roles assigned. If the user gets a link to a tenant of a different customer he will get a not authorized error. There is no Catena-X specfic check based on the bpn necessary.

Summary: the user of company 1 will only retrieve jwt token roles/client attributes for the DFT Instance 1. The user of company 2 only receives a JWT token roles/client attributes for DFT instance 2. In case the user is trying to login to another DFT Instance, a JWT token will get created, but the section
