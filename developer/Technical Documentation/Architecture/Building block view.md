# Building Block View

The Portal as an overall product is a complex composition of several interacting solution building blocks, each comprised of a backend (including api and db) and frontend component, depicted in the following blackbox-illustration:

Beyond this view, the portal allows for component integration of other (sub-products) that need to expose user-faced ui-functionality to the Catena-X community members (company and user level).

Currently integrated (or in the process of being integrated) products are:

- Semantic Hub
- BPDM-Pool
- Managed Identity Wallet
- Self-Description Factory
- Clearing House / Gaia-X
- Digital Twin Registry (until decentral DTR is in place)
