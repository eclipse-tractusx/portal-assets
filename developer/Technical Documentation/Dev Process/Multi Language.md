# Multi Language

## Summary

Multi-Language support is planned for the Portal and Registration App in two languages
<br>

- English
- German
  <br>
  <br>
  The multi language function is mainly implemented on front-end side via i18next.
  <br>
  I18next is an internationalization-framework for react and ideal to support multi language function in web applications.
  <br>
  <br>

i18next provides following add-ons:

- detect the user language
- load the translations
- optionally cache the translations
- extension, by using post-processing - e.g. to enable sprintf support

## Technical Implementation

### Portal-Registration

There is a locales folder in src which contains subfolders according to respective language codes as shown in the screenshot shared, like 'de'(German), 'en'(English). These folders contain the translation.json file used for translations.

We can add additional translation files if needed for any additional language.

<br>

### CX-Portal

Inside the CX Portal, the locales are divided by pages.

<br>
There is one main file holding the generic translation for often used items (e.g. "approval button", headlines,...) and a file for each specific page to translate not often used values.
