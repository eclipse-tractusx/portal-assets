### Implementation Details/Logics UI

- [ ] When the user clicks "cancel" page {hostname}/serviceoverview gets displayed again
- [ ] The "save" button is only active; if the checkbox is clicked
- [ ] As long as the "Save" button is deactivated, the user gets a tooltip displayed (above the Save button) with the information "Please confirm that you have read the deactivation impact above before proceeding". (text is fetched from locales file)
- [ ] the text next to the checkbox is provided via the locales file
- [ ] the service card displayed on the screen is created based on the data of the service inside the cache
- [ ] when the user clicks on "save" the PUT call /deactivateService is getting triggered; until an api response is available, the load element shows up inside the button (see screenshot below)
- [ ] when the api is responding with an success; the user gets directed back to {hostname}/serviceoverview and a success toast message is getting displayed (new notification snackbar element with auto closure set to "true")

### Implementation Details/Logics BE

Business Logic:

set the service status to "INACTIVE" inside the table offers

<br>

Validation:

- validate of the object (serviceId) has the type "Service" inside the table offers.offer_type_id
  - if yes, proceed
  - if no, error "Service not found"
- validate if the user which triggers the endpoint belongs to the same company ID as the service itself (by comparing user company id from the table company_users with the service company id inside the table offers.company_provider_id)
  - if yes, proceed
  - if no, error "Service not found or permissions missing"
- validate if the service has the status "ACTIVE" by looking for the status inside the table offers.offer_status_id
  - if yes, proceed
  - if no, error "Request declined. Incorrect Service Status"
